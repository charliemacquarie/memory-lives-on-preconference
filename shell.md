# Intro to Unix Shell
*Extremely brief intro*

This will be an extremely brief intro to the use of the Unix Shell for entering commands on your computer. If you find yourself compelled by the material in this lesson, I'd encourage you to check out the Software Carpentry Lesson all about the Unix Shell, which has much more information than will be covered here. You can find that lesson [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

We will begin by opening up a shell.

If you are on a windows computer, you will likely be using GitBash, which you downloaded in preparation. To find it, press the windows key and begin typing "gitbash." GitBash should come up in the results -- click on it to open the program.

If you are on a mac computer, you can either open your applications folder and navigate to the "Utilities" folder and find Terminal in that folder, or you can press command+spacebar to open Spotlight and then type "terminal" into the search bar.

Either way, when you open it up you will get something that looks like this (though likely with different colors)

This is a way to interact with your computer by typing commands that tell it what to do. (As opposed to using a GUI or Graphical User Interface -- which is what you are using when you are clicking around on your desktop with a mouse). We are only going to go over a few very simple commands which will allow us to start a jupyter notebook to continue the next lesson, but anything you might be able to do with the click of a mouse you can also do by typing into the terminal -- and sometimes which much more power and flexibility.

When we are asking you to type a command we will preface the command with a "$" symbol -- like this:

`$             `

The "$" indicates that we are asking you to type a command into the terminal, and press the enter key to run the command. You do not type the "$", only the text that follows it. Different systems may use different symbols (on linux it may be a "#"), but generally think of the "$" as just an indicator that we are asking you to type a command.
