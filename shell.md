# Intro to Unix Shell
*Extremely brief intro*

This will be an extremely brief intro to the use of the Unix Shell for entering commands on your computer. If you find yourself compelled by the material in this lesson, I'd encourage you to check out the Software Carpentry Lesson all about the Unix Shell, which has much more information than will be covered here. You can find that lesson [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

We will begin by opening up a shell.

If you are on a windows computer, you will likely be using GitBash, which you downloaded in preparation. To find it, press the windows key and begin typing "gitbash." GitBash should come up in the results -- click on it to open the program.

If you are on a mac computer, you can either open your applications folder and navigate to the "Utilities" folder and find Terminal in that folder, or you can press command+spacebar to open Spotlight and then type "terminal" into the search bar.

Either way, when you open it up you will get something that looks like this (though likely with different colors)
