In addition, NGLTFiscalling onits more than 17,000 members nationwide, as well as other gay and lesbian organizations and individuals, to boycott the conference, scheduled forthis June 20-24 in San Francisco, Calif. NGLTF is encouragingactivists to continue pressuring the government to repeal thepolicies. NGLTF is thefirst reportednational U.S. gay and lesbian civil rights organizationto boycott the conference. The Task Force joins more than 35 national and international organizations that have chosen not to participate in the gathering, including the National Association of Peoplewith AIDS, the International League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the Canadian AIDS Society, Shanti Project and the Names Project International AIDS Memorial Quilt. NGLTF\\'s decisionto boycott the conference was made byits board of directors at the Nashville, Tenn., board meeting on March 18. NGLTF leaders said the group would rescindits boycott onlyiftravel restrictions on peoplewith AIDS and gays and lesbians arelifted. \"We believe the U.S. governmentpolicy of denying entry to gay men and lesbians and peoplewith AIDS and HIVis morally reprehensible,\" said veteran NGLTF board member Rick Rudy. Rudy, an openly gay personwith AIDS, is also president of the Bay Area-based High Tech Gays, which is strongly consideringjoining the boycott. \"We do not feel the conference can accomplishits tasksif those most concerned are prohibited from attending.\" Under current law, any persontestingHIV-positive may be excluded from the U.S., includingtourists, refugees, people seeking asylum and legalization, students, persons with special visas to teach or conduct research, as well as persons who have lived legally in the U.S. as students, laborers, or permanent residents and are now seekingnaturalization as citizens. - more - pgNbr=11 Individuals coming from outside the U.S. can be denied temporary admission or detained at the border, which has occurred in Minneapolis, Minn, and other locations. HIV was added to thelist ofrestricted communicable diseases, including tuberculosis, syphilis and gonorrhea, by an amendment offered by Sen. Jesse Helmsto the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1987. Waivers for some individualswith AIDS or HIV may be granted forlimited orrestricted entryinto the U.S. Following considerable mediacriticism and pressure from AIDS and other groups, the Immigration andNaturalization Service in January announcedit would stop marking passports of thosewith HIV infection who are granted waivers to enter the country. \"NGLTF condemns anyprohibitions on immigration, visitation and naturalization of HIV-infected persons as well as restrictions on lesbians and gay men,\" said Urvashi Vaid, NGLTF executivedirector. \"AIDS is not imported into the U.S. There must be notravel restrictions on foreigners with AIDS or HIV or on gay men and lesbians.\" — The U.S.-has more than 121,000 cases of AIDS, by far the \" greatest number of reported cases of any country in the world. Vaid pointed outthat the World Health Organization, the Presidential Commission on the HIV epidemic, the National AIDS Commission and other groups have rejectedrestrictions on HIV positive persons as unnecessary, counterproductive and a waste of resources. Organizers of the VI International Conference of AIDS say the conference stands to lose several thousandparticipantsif the current immigrationpolicies are enforced. President George Bush has declined aninvitation to speakat the gathering, which is traditionally opened by the head of state of the host country. In addition to fightingdiscriminatory AIDSpolicies, NGLTF is involved in lobbyingfor passage oflegislation that would repeal anti-gay and lesbian immigration law. Abill offered by openly gay Representative Barney Frank would change existing law that prohibits foreigners fromvisiting or applying for permanent residence in the U.S. based ontheir sexual orientation. NGLTF is the oldest and preeminent national gay and lesbian civil rights organization in the U.S. Founded in 1973, the Task Force fights forfull equality for lesbians and gay men and responsible federal AIDSpolicies. ### prboycott pgNbr=12 NATIONAL GAY & LESBIAN TASK FORCE 1517 U STREET NW ■ WASHINGTON, DC 20009 ■ 202/332-6483 for more information: for immediate release Robert Bray or Urvashi Vaid (202) 332-6483 NGLTF executivedirectorprotests bushpolicies atpresidentialaids address Washington, D.C., March 29, 1990...President George Bush\\'sfirst major address on the AIDS healthcrisis was interrupted today by Urvashi Vaid, executivedirector of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF), who stood up during the presentation and urged the Presidentto do morefor peoplewith AIDS. Bush spoke to a gathering of about 400 business and labor leaders at a conference sponsored by the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS held at the Crystal City GatewayMarriott Hotel just outside Washington. The speech was extensively covered by major national and international media. During the speech, Vaid, who sat in front of the President, stood and held up a signthat read, \"TalkIs Cheap — AIDS Funding Is Not\" and \"Remember Gay People With AIDS.\" She then challenged Bushdirectly, saying, \"Mr. President, youdon\\'t understand. We need your leadership. We need more than one speech every 14 months. We need more funding for AIDS education, research and prevention. We need youto end the discriminatory immigrationpolicy.\" Secret Service agents instructed Vaid to remove the sign and sit down. But a few minutes later, Vaid again stoodto address the President, who uptothat point in his speech had not revealed any new substantiveAdministrationinitiatives for fighting the epidemic. Vaid was then escorted out of the hotel andtoldif she reentered she would be arrested. Bush paused duringhis speech to address Vaid, saying, \"Let me say something aboutthis. I can understand the concernthat these people feel. AndI hopeif we do nothing else by coming here, I can help them understandthat not only you care, but we caretoo.\" Duringhis speech. Bush urged compassion for peoplewith AIDS. He mentioned education, \"AIDS babies,\" confidentiality, the \"war on drugs,\" and praisedAllstate Company, Fortune Magazine and General Motors for fighting the disease. Among other things. Bush touted theAdministration\\'s response to AIDS. - more - pgNbr=13 \"The epidemic is having a major impact on our health care I system,\" said Bush. \"The Federal response is unprecedented.\" Bush renewedhis support for the Americans WithDisabilities \\' Act, which he said must be immediately passedto ban discrimination against peoplewith AIDS and HIV. \"It is commendablethat the President mentioned anti¬ discrimination protections,\" said Vaidafter the speech. \"And his rhetoric was certainly more compassionate than anything former President Reagan ever said. But one speech does not equal leadership. Photo opportunities and soundbites on compassion are not substitutes for public healthpolicy andpolitical courage.\" In particular, Vaidcriticized the White House\\'s AIDS funding proposal for 1991. Duringhis speech. Bush said the Administration had asked Congress for $3.5billion in 1991 for AIDS. But AIDS advocates sharplycriticized and rebukedthat figure, sayingafter Medicaid and Medicare entitlements. Defense Departmenttesting costs and othermiscellaneous expenses are factored out, the actual Bush AIDS budget request for 1991 for Labor, Health and Humans Services expenditures is $1.75billion. The day before the President\\'s address, NGLTF\\'s Vaid testified before the Senate Appropriations committee in support of increased federal AIDS funding. Vaid, on behalf of the National Organizations Responding to AIDS (NORA), of which NGLTF is a member, asked for $2.8billionto meet anticipated HIV prevention, care and research needs in 1991. The NORA proposal emphasizes immediate impact aid torelieve those communities hardesthit by the epidemic. \"What is missing from the President\\'spicture of AIDS?,\" asked Vaid. \"An end to punitive and harmful immigration, visitation and permanent residency laws that discriminate against foreigners with AIDS and HIV. Increased funding of AIDS research, prevention and care programs. Affordable health care forall Americans. Access to promising drug therapies. Acknowledgement that the gay community, which comprises more than 65 percent oftotal AIDS cases, continues to suffer discrimination, stigmatization and government negligence. And a real action plan forfighting thenation\\'s healthcrisis.\" OUT!, a D.C.-baseddirect action group, joined the New York and D.C. chapters of ACT UPto stage a protest at the hotel during the speech. In order to enter thehotel\\'s conference site, attendees, most of them corporate executives and business leaders, had to walk through a human \"gauntlet\" of about 80 AIDS activists lining both sides of the hallway. Activists carried signs that said, among other things, \"Wake Up George — Where\\'s The Plan?\" and \"Nine Years of AIDS + 80,000 Dead + One Lousy Speech = A National Disgrace.\" ### pgNbr=14 SIXTHINTERNATIONALCONFERENCEONAIDS \\'SAN\\'FRANCISCO,CALIFORNIA USA•20-24JUNE1990 March 20,1990 DearExecutive Director, Weare writingtorequestyourhelpwithtwoneedsoftheSixthInternationalConferenceon AIDS -our delegatehost andvolunteerprograms.

TEL41-22-330395 PftGE 04 THE LEAGUE OF RED CROSS AND RED CRESCENT SOCIETIES\\' POSITION ON ATTENDANCE AT THE VIth INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AIDS. San Francisco - June 20-24, 1990. The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies decided in Novenber, 1989» to withdraw from participating in the Vlth International Conference on AIDS. The reasons for this withdrawal were clearly outlined at the time, and centred around our concern that the U.S. visa policyfor people who are HIV positive might cause discrimination to HIV positive membersof Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies who wished to attend the Conference. A second statement was issued from the LeagueSecretariat In January, 1990, following some revisions In the applicationof thevisawaiver procedureforpeople who are HIV positive and who wished to attend the Vlth International AIDS Conference. Despite the welcome changes, it was considered that theydidnot significantlyalter the potential for discriminationof membersofNational Societies, and our position on attending the Conference remainedunaltered. There have beenfurther recent changes to the visa waiver procedure, and once again we wouldlike to express our solidarity and support forall those peoplewithin the United States of America who have helped to bring about these changes. Including the American Red Cross. Although theexactdetailsof the changes and, in particular, the practical procedures for their implementation remain somewhat unclear, from the available Information the concerns of the League about possible discrimination of HIV positive membersof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies remain. We have therefore decided to remain with our original position and not participate in the Conference. This decision was supported during the recent meetingof the European and North American Red Cross and Red Crescent Task Force on AIDS, and is shared by manyInternational nongovernmental organisations and a number of governments. We continue to urge USpolicy makers to make the necessary changes totheir laws concerning people who are HIV positive, in order to ensurethat these laws and related regulations and procedures are based on sound public health principles and a caring and humanitarian approach toall people. Since the Conference is now less than a month away, andin vtewof the need to take a final decision about our participation. Irrespective of further changes in U.S. visa policy procedures the Leagueof Red Cross and Red CrescentSocieties will not participate In theVlth International Conference on AIDS. 22 May, 1990 DBDSFAID/LCT52/MICHAEL pgNbr=24 May 23 *90 9:12 0000 LICROSS GENEUfl, SUITZ. TEL41-22-330395 PPlGE 05 r 7 |t\\' ^ c Unfortunately thereis anegative side to our withdrawal from this Conference. Itis very unfortunate that the Leagueof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and many other NGCs will be absent from this Conference at a time whenit is clearly so important that we develop partnerships and that all sectors and organisations cooperate and work together. It is clear to everyone that NQOs have played a very important role in the fight against AIDS .... their absence will, I believe, make this only a partial Conference, and will have a serious negative affect on the outcome. The positive aspectof our withdrawal is that we have helpedto bring about changes in the travel restrictions in the USA by providing supportfor those peoplewithin the USA who have fought for these changes. However, despite some progress, asof mid May thereisstill a great deal of confusion and lackof clarity about what these changes actually are, and how they would be implemented in practice. We remain unconvinced that they significantlyallay our concerns about potentialdiscriminationofour members. We have also shown that as a \"community\", NGOs, at least, are still able to take moral stands on Issuesof international and individual importance. And we have demonstratedthat even though there are as many differences between NGOs as similarities, on important matters we can stand together, speakwith onevoice and act as a consciencefor the International community. I wish you every success with your Conference and hope thatit makes an important contribution to the fight against AIDS. However, I also hope that weall leam from this experience, and that such asituation will not be allowed to happen again. Exchange of ideas, experiences and information is certainly essentialif we are to combat the AIDS pandemic. Butthiswill only beusefulif advances can be putintopractice, andinorder to dothis we need to be able to ensure a caring and compassionate environment, thatis as freeofdiscrimination as we wouldlikeit to be freeof the virus and all the sufferingthatthisvirus causes. PBDVIDE0/LCT52/MICHAEL 23.05.90 pgNbr=25 Pfir Stenb^ck Video messag;e to the VIth INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AIDS; San Francisco, June 20- 24, 1990. For the past 125 years, the symbolof the Red Cross has stoodfor compassion and humanity.It was born outof one man\\'s horror and concern about the wounded and dying who lay uncared for and unattended on thebattle-fieldofSolferino. Since this time, the Red Cross has devoted Itself to preventing andalleviating the sufferingof vulnerable individuals and communities around the world. Irrespective of their race, religion, political or Ideologicalbeliefs. Over the years thebattle-fields have changed. Today, we have many new challenges, such as economic recession, environmental pollution and AIDS. The Leagueof Red Cross and Red CrescentSocieties, withNational Societiesin 149 countries around theworld, has been veryactive in the fight against AIDS. More than 100 Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies currently have AIDS relatedactivities: helping to prevent the spreadof thevirus and toprovide care and support for people who are HIV positive, people with AIDS, theirloved ones, families and friends. We have also taken averystrongstand against the pandemic of discrimination that has followed the HIV/AIDS pandemic, both because webelieve thatdiscriminationis fundamentally wrong and also because, from a public health polnt-of-vlew, preventing discrimination is essential to preventing the spreadof thevirus. The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has participatedinprevious International Conferences on AIDS, and as our involvementwith the global effort has increased so has our involvementwilii these Conferences. Last year, at the Conference inMontreal, we had more than fortyrepresentatives fromthirty countries. This year, however, apart fromthis video message we will not be participating. We arenot participatingin theVIthInternational AIDS Conference because we are concerned that the currenttravel restrictions fdr people who wish to enter the United Statesof America may cause discrimination to membersof the League of -Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies who are HIV positive and who attend the Conference. This Is obviously of great concern to us since we have consistently taken astrongstand againstdiscrimination and since we have encouragedNational Societies toInvolve people who are HIV positive and peoplewith AIDSintheir programmes because of the Important perspective and experiences that theybring. Of course there are broader Issues at stake, and we addourvoice to the concern expressed by thepublichealthauthoritieswithin theUnitedStates and by the World Health Organisation about any travelrestrictions which singleout people who are HIVpositive, since thesewill do nothing toprevent the spreadof the disease but are likely to bepunitive anddiscriminatory. Such measures merelyreinforce the attitudes that «fork against thecontrolof this dreadful disease, and Insteadof preventing the spread they act as anobstacle to prevention. pgNbr=26 i Conference BoycottGathersSteam A numberofother OtherAIDSservice byKevinFarrell organizationsfromEurope groupshavejoined The the boycott against the Sixth joined theboycottdue to their concems boycott, including the National IntemationaiAIDSConferencehas aboutINS Associationof gained policies.

Many other problems are not in this list—for example, expense and low- cost access. This writeup is NOT for attribution unless I have an editorial role in the statement as a whole—probably not feasible. Problems with Sixth International Conference: • All abstracts had to be submitted five months in advance. And wording on the abstract forms discouraged researchers from presenting their work elsewhere in the interval. As a result, the Conference cast a five-month \"shadow\" ahead of it--a time of year when researchers are most reluctant to reveal to the public what they know. • This five-month gap would (hopefully) discourage researchers with critically important results from submitting them to the Conference at all, as it would be objectionable to conceal important health information for months. Therefore, the Conference policy on early submission and exclusivity almost guarantees that the most important advances will not be released at the Conference at all-- except perhaps by researchers who submitted an abstract on something else and obtained a speaker or poster slot. • The inflexibility of the Sixth International has forced researchers with late-breaking results to take them to the \"alternative\" conference (Advanced Immune Discoveries Symposium, at Le Meridien Hotel a block away) instead; one example is the hyperthermia treatment recently tried in Atlanta. The International Conference also should be able to accommodate the most important fast-developing stories. • Conference participants cannot see the abstracts until they register. Then it is too late to read or scan the thousands of abstracts before meetings start. This lack of advance information makes pgNbr=32 2 participants spend valuable Conference time figuring out what is going on, instead of planning which posters to visit in advance. • Over 1,500 abstracts were rejected this year--compared to almost none rejected by last year\\' International Conference in Montreal. Yet no one today can be sure what will prove important in AIDS research. And abstracts are harder to judge than larger papers, because less information is available. As a result, decisions are unduly influenced by whether reviewers know the authors or know their reputations. Observations which do not fit with conventional theories are unlikely to survive this system—despite the clear inadequacy of the existing understanding of AIDS. • The abstract form for next year\\'s conference in Florence, Italy again requires a five-month delay and exclusivity. Therefore under current plans, mostif not all of the problems cited above are likely to be repeated next year. pgNbr=33 STATEMENTOF JEANMCGUIRE Executive Director,AIDSActionCouncil AIDS June22,1990 Action Council Today,theAIDSActionCouncilis launching a boycottoftheSanFranciscoMarriott Hotelfoodservicesto protesttheCorporation\\'s supportofthe Chapman amendmenttothe Americanswith Disabilities(ADA)Act.

Marriott is the headquarters site for the SixthInternationalConference on AIDS,which seeks to translate sound scientific findings into reasonable public policy.

Wedemandaccesstoallinformationaffectingour lives. Wedemandavoicein everystepoftheprocessfromtheinceptionofanidea forresearch, throughtheactualresearch,upuntiltheideabecomesareality. Furthermore, wedemand: 1. Access to quality health care to all people worldwide, regardless of abilityto pay. Health care is a right! 2. Access to effective research programs for AIDS/HIV and other Immune System Disorders. These programs must bedesignedto save the lives of the hundreds ofthousands of people worldwide who are expected to diefrom AIDS in the nextthree years. 3. Unbiased information on and access to alternative treatments including vitamin and herbal therapies, acupuncture, homeopathy, and other non-pharmaceuticaltreatments. To this end, alternative treatmentsmustbeincludedinofficialconferencesandAIDSservicereferrals. Thesetreatmentsmustbecovered byprivateandgovernmenthealthinsurance plans. Wehavearighttomakeinformedchoicesamongallpossibletreatments. 4. The expansion and/or initiation of studies of disease progression and detection in groups who may have a different responseto HIV because of biochemical or cultural differences including women, transexuals, injection drug users, children, adolescents, and people of color. 5. An end to placebo-controlled trials for treatments of life-threatening conditions. For manypeople,clinicaltrialsaretheonlyformofhealthcare available. Placebotrialsareimmoralbecause theypreventtreatmentandaccess to healthcare. 6. Worldwide accessfor all Peoplewith Immune System Disorders to data.

Civil rightsfor all Peoplewith Immune System Disorders. We need anti¬ discrimination legislationprotectingjobs, housingandaccesstoservices: full legal recognitionoflesbian, gay,andbisexual relationships; respectfortransexual rights; anonymousandabsolutelyconfidential HIV antibodytestingaswell aspre- and post-test counseling;housingthatmeetsthemedical needsofPeoplewith Immune SystemDisorders;substance-abusetreatment;thesamestandardofcare andtreatmentfor prisonersasforthe generalpopulation; therightofpeoplefaced witha life-threateningillnesstochoosetreatmentstheydeembeneficialfor themselves;to stop mandatorytestingandquarantineunderanycircumstances;to endallrestrictionson theinternationalmovementor immigrationofpeoplewith HIV;toendtheforcedsterilizationofwomen enrolling inresearchprotocols;andto stopresearchwith prisonersunderduressorwithoutinformedconsent. 8. The legislation and regulations of all governments must reflect the factthat HIV is not commonly contagious. Casual contact presents no threatof infection,andirrationalfearsoftransmission mustbe fought. 9. Access to international education programs outlining comprehensive sex information affirming and supportive of all sexual orientations in culturally sensitive ways and describing safer sex, needle hygiene and other means of preventing Sexually Transmitted Diseases, HIV and other viruses. 10. Access to health care. * All governments and all international health organizations must treat AIDS and other Immune System Disorders positively and aggressively. Ensuringaccessandavailability oftreatmentmustbe partofthe socialandmoral obligationsof governmentstotheircitizens. AIDSresearchand healthcare funding mustnotcompetewithother pressing healthcarepriorities. Theentirebiomedicalresearch budgetmustbe drasticallyincreasedtomeetthe world\\'s healthcarecrisis. Inthe U.S.,allbranchesofthe governmentmust provideleadershipand a comprehensive,coordinatedAIDS research, education,and preventioneffort,withenhanced fundingtokeeppacewiththe epidemic. * Primary health care provisions must be comprehensive, providing culturally sensitive care and information for the individual and her/his family. * Recognition that in most parts of the world, poverty is a critical co- factor in immune suppression. Thus, industrialized nations mustestablish an internationally developedfundtoassistpoorand developingcountriesto meet theirhealthcare responsibilities includingthe provisionofcondoms,facilitiesfor aclean blood supplyand adequatesuppliesofsterileneedlesaswellasafull rangeofmedicalservicesandtreatmentsandeducationalmaterials. Inaddition, conversionof militaryspendingworldwideto medical healthandbasicsocial services isessential. pgNbr=43 11. Access to an international health organization seriously dedicated to combatting immuneSystemDisorders. WecondemntheWorld Health Organization(WHO)forfailingtocoordinateaninternationalresponsetothe AIDS epidemicandfornotaddressingImmuneSystemDisorders. Wedemandan internationallycoordinatedefforttohaltAIDSandotherimmuneSystem Disorders,to providetreatmentforallpeopleinfectedwithimmuneSystem Disorders,andtoadvocateforthosewhoarediscriminatedagainstand oppressedduetotheirimmunestatus. 12. Participatory power in the decision making process regarding researchandtreatment. Restructure theAIDSClinicalTrial Group(ACTG) of theU.S.NationalInstitutesofHealthdecision making. TheACTGExecutive Committeemustberestructuredtoinclude representativesofallACTGcommittees andfromthecommunitiesaffected byAIDS. We demand thatthe ACTG: * Revealconflictsofinterest. All ACTG-funded investigators must make publicdetailsofall financial andhistoricallinks theymaintainwithpharmaceuticalsponsors. They mustabstainfromtheselection processwherethesesponsors\\'drugsareinvolved. \\' Focus on developing NEWtreatments. TheACTG mustresearch all promising newtreatments,includingnon-drugtreatmentssuchasPassive Immuno-Therapy, insmall,technologyintensive Phasei/ilsafety/activitystudies, to getnew effectivetreatmentsoutthedoor. Then,pharmaceuticalsponsorsand community-basedgroupscanconductlargertreatmenttrials. * Focus ontheentire range of AIDSmorbidity and mortality. Over90 percentofAIDSdeatharecausedbyopportunisticinfections(Ols);butjust 17 percentofACTGsubjectssofarhavebeenin01trials. TheACTGmust immediatelystarttrialsdesignedtopreventortreatthemostseriousand widespreadOls:CMV, MAI, fungal infections,toxoplasmosis,cryptosporidiosis; the HIVassociated cancers, KSand lymphomas:andchlamydiaandothervaginal Olsthatoccurinwomen livingwithAIDS. * Diversifyresearch priorities.

The future ofHIVtreatmentlieswithcombination therapy. It\\'stimetoinitiatenationwide combinationtrialswith alternatingorsequentialanti-HIVagents,plusimmune- rebuildingtreatmentsandmulti-opportunisticinfectionprophylaxis. pgNbr=44 * End medical apartheid-open trials to ALL HIV-infected people. ACTGtrials mustbe opentotheentire spectrumoftheHIVinfected population. Exclusion criteriamustbe compensatedfor byopenenrollment safety/treatment trialsforallAIDS complications. Enrollmentof underrepresentedgroups, including women, African-Americans, Latinos/as, Native Americans, Asians, Pacific Islanders,and presentandformer drugusers,mustbeenhanced throughthe provision of health care, transportation subsidies,childcareandaddiction treatment. * Streamline pediatrictreatment access. The ACTG must designtreatment trialsforchildren and adolescentsassoonastreatments provesafe inadultPhase I studies. \" Provide state-of-the-art clinical care within AIDS clinical trials. ACTGtrialsmust provide participantswithstate-of-the-art therapies as they evolve. * Rapidlytranslate results into clinical practice. NIAID\\'s Division of AIDS mustestablish an Officeof HIV/AIDSClinical Careto providestate-of-the-art treatment guidelines,andtooverseethe rapidtranslationoftrial resultsinto clinical practice. * Conduct research where the need is greatest. When the ACTU grants are renewed, researchsites should be established in high-incidence areas nowunserved. AIDS researchand healthcare needto be provided together in all high HIVincidenceareas. \\' Funding for the various ACTG sites should be apportioned on the basis of the needs of the community served and the willingness of the Principal Investigators to comply with the above demands. 13. Access to ail government functions affecting the AIDS crisis. All NIH AIDS meetings, includingthose ofNIAID,itsDivision of AIDS, ACTG conferencesand core committees,theAIDSClinical Drug DevelopmentCommittee andthe National Cooperative Drug Discovery Groupsmustbe open internationallyto Peoplewith Immune System Disorders includingactivistsandthe press. 14. Alteration of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control\\'s (CDC) definition of AIDS to reflect the full spectrum and diversity of AIDS and HIV-related diseases. The current definition of AIDS is obsolete. It denies treatment,care,andsocialservicesto poorpeoplewho donotfittheir definition of AIDS. 11doesnot include opportunistic infectionsthat affect children, adolescents,women, people ofcolor, and injection drugusers. As aresult,wearedeniedaccess to life-saving treatments. Italsodenies earlyintervention therapytoasymptomaticHIV infected people. Thecurrentdefinition is designedtoundercountthefull extentofthe pandemic, resulting inalackof funding. pgNbr=45 I 15. Decriminalization of needle possession and immediate implementation of government funded programs to provide effective appropriate treatment on demand and distribution of free sterile needles for injection drug users. 16. Access to all AIDS conferencesfor People with Immune System Disorders (PISD) must beguaranteed. All future AIDSconferences must beheldincountriesthatdonothavetravelrestrictionsbasedonHIV status, race, pastorpresentdruguse,orsexualorientation. AllPISDmustbegivenfreeentry intotheconferences. PISDfromnon-industrializedcountriesmustbe giventravel scholarshipstoattend. PISDmustberepresentedonallconferencepanels. pgNbr=46 NO MORE WORD S WE WANT ACTION Thus far duringthis conference, ACT UP has made manypoints without disrupting the exchange ofscientific information. However, today\\'s scheduled speech by Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Louis B. Sullivan, is not ascientific presentation. After 10 years of Bush/Reagan rhetoric on AIDS, wewill no longer tolerate words without action. You will not hear Louis Sullivan today. THE BUSH/SULLIVAN CRIMES THE \"We have to WORDS: fight the disease, not the people with the disease.\" THE ACTION: HIV-positive individuals are denied entry to and deported from the U.S.A. \"We are on a war-time THE WORDS: footing against AIDS ...\" THE The Bush Administration ACTION: opposes the AIDS CARE legislation intended to provide disasterrelief funds for devastated communities. THE WORDS: \"Every time there is a promising [treatment] opportunity, we pursueit.\" THE ACTION: ACT UP has identified over 99 drugs that have shown promise as possible AIDS treatments. VIRTUALLY NONE OF THESE ARE SLATED FOR GOVERNMENT TRIALS. THE WORDS: \"Clean needle exchange programs are a viable option in control of the spread of HIV among IV drug users.\" THE ACTION: Just as Louis Sullivan has abandoned women byflip-flopping on abortion, so he has abandoned IV drug users by flip-flopping on needle exchange and bleachdistribution programs, leaving themto die. THE WORDS: \"I want a kinder, gentlernation.\" THE ACTION: The Bush Administration says this nation cannot afford to offer health care to over 37 million uninsured Americans. The U.S. and SouthAfrica remain the only industrialized nations without national health care. WE INVITE YOU TO JOIN US IN PROTEST. STAND AND TURN YOUR BACK ON SULLIVAN AND HIS MEANINGLESS RHETORIC. pgNbr=47 Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Louis B. Sullivan, as the highest ranking governmentofficial and a personof color, has failed to voice the concerns of communities of color regarding the spread of HIVinfection. People of color are disproportionately over-represented in the demographics of this epidemic. Entire generations are being wiped out. Yet Dr. Sullivan\\'s prescription is an absurd health policydictated bypartisanpolitics. We demand effective and humane leadership. Science, notpolitics. Education, not ignorance. Health care, not lip service. pgNbr=48 TOALLTHEGRANT GRABBERS,EMPIRE BUILDERS,EGOTRIPPERS INTHESCIENTinCANDMEDICAL COMMUNITIESWHOSEONLYINTEREST ISCUTTINGUPTHE AIDSPIERESULTINGINONEMILUONDEATHS WORLDWIDEAND20MILUON INFECTIONS,DOUBUNGANNUALLY.

George Bush'sfirst major address on the AIDS healthcrisis was interrupted today by Urvashi Vaid, executivedirector of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF), who stood up during the presentation and urged the Presidentto do morefor peoplewith AIDS.\", 'Bush spoke to a gathering of about 400 business and labor leaders at a conference sponsored by the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS held at the Crystal City GatewayMarriott Hotel just outside Washington.', 'The speech was extensively covered by major national and international media.', 'During the speech, Vaid, who sat in front of the President, stood and held up a signthat read, \"TalkIs Cheap — AIDS Funding Is Not\" and \"Remember Gay People With AIDS.\"', 'She then challenged Bushdirectly, saying, \"Mr. President, youdon\\'t understand.', 'We need your leadership.', 'We need more than one speech every 14 months.', 'We need more funding for AIDS education, research and prevention.', 'We need youto end the

the speech.', '\"And his rhetoric was certainly more compassionate than anything former President Reagan ever said.', 'But one speech does not equal leadership.', 'Photo opportunities and soundbites on compassion are not substitutes for public healthpolicy andpolitical courage.\"', \"In particular, Vaidcriticized the White House's AIDS funding proposal for 1991.\", 'Duringhis speech.', 'Bush said the Administration had asked Congress for $3.5billion in 1991 for AIDS.', 'But AIDS advocates sharplycriticized and rebukedthat figure, sayingafter Medicaid and Medicare entitlements.', 'Defense

CONFERENCE ON AIDS.\", 'San Francisco - June 20-24, 1990.', 'The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies decided in Novenber, 1989» to withdraw from participating in the Vlth International Conference on AIDS.', 'The reasons for this withdrawal were clearly outlined at the time, and centred around our concern that the U.S. visa policyfor people who are HIV positive might cause discrimination to HIV positive membersof Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies who wished to attend the Conference.', 'A second statement was issued from the LeagueSecretariat In January, 1990, following some revisions In the applicationof thevisawaiver procedureforpeople who are HIV positive and who wished to attend the Vlth International AIDS Conference.', 'Despite the welcome changes, it was considered that theydidnot significantlyalter the potential for discriminationof membersofNational Societies, and our position on attending the Conference remainedunaltered.', 'There have beenfurther recent changes to the visa waiver procedure, and once again we wouldlike to express our solidarity and support forall those peoplewithin the United States of America who have helped to bring about these changes.', 'Including the American Red Cross.', 'Although theexactdetailsof the changes and, in particular, the practical procedures for their implementation remain somewhat unclear, from the available Information the concerns of the League about possible discrimination of HIV positive membersof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies remain.', 'We have therefore decided to remain with our original position and not participate in the Conference.', 'This decision was supported during the recent meetingof the European and North American Red Cross and Red Crescent Task Force on AIDS, and is shared by manyInternational nongovernmental organisations and a number of governments.', 'We continue to urge USpolicy makers to make the necessary changes totheir laws concerning people who are HIV positive, in order to ensurethat these laws and related regulations and procedures are based on sound public health principles and a caring and humanitarian approach toall people.', 'Since the Conference is now less than a month away, andin vtewof the need to take a final decision about our participation.', 'Irrespective of further changes in U.S. visa policy procedures the Leagueof Red Cross and Red CrescentSocieties will not participate In theVlth International Conference on AIDS.', '22 May, 1990 DBDSFAID/LCT52/MICHAEL pgNbr=24 May 23 *90 9:12 0000 LICROSS GENEUfl, SUITZ.', \"TEL41-22-330395 PPlGE 05 r 7 |t' ^ c Unfortunately thereis anegative side to our withdrawal from this Conference.\", 'Itis very unfortunate that the Leagueof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and many other NGCs will be absent from this Conference at a time whenit is clearly so important that we develop partnerships and that all sectors and organisations cooperate and work together.', 'It is clear to everyone that NQOs have played a very important role in the fight against AIDS .... their absence will, I believe, make this only a partial Conference, and will have a serious negative affect on the outcome.', 'The positive aspectof our withdrawal is that we have helpedto bring about changes in the travel restrictions in the USA by providing supportfor those peoplewithin the USA who have fought for these changes.', 'However, despite some progress, asof mid May thereisstill a great deal of confusion and lackof clarity about what these changes actually are, and how they would be implemented in practice.', 'We remain unconvinced that they significantlyallay our concerns about potentialdiscriminationofour members.', 'We have also shown that as a \"community\", NGOs, at least, are still able to take moral stands on Issuesof international and individual importance.', 'And we have demonstratedthat even though there are as many differences between NGOs as similarities, on important matters we can stand together, speakwith onevoice and act as a consciencefor the International community.', 'I wish you every success with your Conference and hope thatit makes an important contribution to the fight against AIDS.', 'However, I also hope that weall leam from this experience, and that such asituation will not be allowed to happen again.', 'Exchange of ideas, experiences and information is certainly essentialif we are to combat the AIDS pandemic.', 'Butthiswill only beusefulif advances can be putintopractice, andinorder to dothis we need to be able to ensure a caring

preventing andalleviating the sufferingof vulnerable individuals and communities around the world.', 'Irrespective of their race, religion, political or Ideologicalbeliefs.', 'Over the years thebattle-fields have changed.', 'Today, we have many new challenges, such as economic recession, environmental pollution and AIDS.', 'The Leagueof Red Cross and Red CrescentSocieties, withNational

prevent the spreadof thevirus and toprovide care and support for people who are HIV positive, people with AIDS, theirloved ones, families and friends.', 'We have also taken averystrongstand against the pandemic of discrimination that has followed the HIV/AIDS pandemic, both because webelieve thatdiscriminationis fundamentally wrong and also because, from a public health polnt-of-vlew, preventing discrimination is essential to preventing the spreadof thevirus.', 'The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has participatedinprevious International Conferences on AIDS, and as our involvementwith the global effort has increased so has our involvementwilii these Conferences.', 'Last year, at the Conference inMontreal, we had more than fortyrepresentatives fromthirty countries.', 'This year, however, apart fromthis video message we will not be participating.', 'We arenot participatingin theVIthInternational AIDS Conference because we are concerned that the currenttravel restrictions fdr people who wish to enter the United Statesof America may cause discrimination to membersof the League of -Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies who are HIV positive and who attend the Conference.', 'This Is obviously of great concern to us since we have consistently taken astrongstand againstdiscrimination and since we have encouragedNational Societies toInvolve people who are HIV positive and peoplewith AIDSintheir programmes because of the Important perspective and experiences that theybring.', 'Of course there are broader Issues at stake, and we addourvoice to the concern expressed by thepublichealthauthoritieswithin theUnitedStates and by the World Health Organisation about any travelrestrictions which singleout people who are HIVpositive, since thesewill do nothing toprevent the spreadof the disease but are likely to bepunitive anddiscriminatory.', 'Such measures merelyreinforce the attitudes that «fork against thecontrolof this dreadful disease, and Insteadof

Florence conference, next year Here are my points about problems with the Conference.', 'Many other problems are not in this list—for example, expense and low- cost access.', 'This writeup is NOT for attribution unless I have an editorial role in the statement as a whole—probably not feasible.', 'Problems with Sixth International Conference: • All abstracts had to be submitted five months in advance.', 'And wording on the abstract forms discouraged researchers from presenting their work elsewhere in the interval.', 'As a result, the Conference cast a five-month \"shadow\" ahead of it--a time of year when researchers are most reluctant to reveal to the public what they know.', '• This five-month gap would (hopefully) discourage researchers with critically important results from submitting them to the Conference at all, as it would be objectionable to conceal important health information for months.', 'Therefore, the Conference policy on early submission and exclusivity

fast-developing stories.', '• Conference participants cannot see the abstracts until they register.', 'Then it is too late to read or scan the thousands of abstracts before meetings start.', 'This

abstracts were rejected this year--compared to almost none rejected by last year' International Conference in Montreal.\", 'Yet no one today can be sure what will prove important in AIDS research.', 'And abstracts are harder to judge than larger papers, because less information is available.', 'As a result, decisions are unduly influenced by whether reviewers know the authors or know their reputations.', 'Observations which do not fit with conventional theories are unlikely to survive this system—despite the clear inadequacy of the existing understanding of AIDS.', \"• The abstract form

supporting the boycott Ho del said While we regret not participating in the conference we felt it was crucial to take a firm political stand protesting the restrictive U S immigration laws', 'It is inexcusable to have such restrictions for which there is no sound public health rationale on the hooks', 'We hope the boycott sends a strong signal to the Bush administration that this policy is unacceptable', \"Ho del had planned to present a paper during one of the conference's Social Science and Policy oral sessions titled ' Buyers ' Clubs ' and the Legit i miz ation of the AIDS Treatment Underground the PW A People With AIDS Health Group as Case Study\", 'In addition Ho del said the PW A Health Group was scheduled to present a poster titled When Safety Nets Fail A Unique Guerilla

AND RED CRESCENT SOCIETIES ' POSITION ON ATTENDANCE AT THE VIth INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AIDS\", 'San Francisco June 20 24 1990', 'The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies decided in N oven ber 1989 to withdraw from participating in the Vl th International Conference on AIDS', 'The reasons for this withdrawal were clearly outlined at the time and centred around our concern that the U S visa policy for people who are HIV positive might cause discrimination to HIV positive members of Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies who wished to attend the Conference', 'A second statement was issued from the League Secretariat In January 1990 following some revisions In the application of the visa waiver procedure for people who are HIV positive and who wished to attend the Vl th International AIDS Conference', 'Despite the welcome changes it was considered that they did not significantly alter the potential for discrimination of members of National Societies and our position on attending the Conference remained unaltered', 'There have been further recent changes to the visa waiver procedure and once again we would like to express our solidarity and support for all those people within the United States of America who have helped to bring about these changes', 'Including the American Red Cross', 'Although the exact details of the changes and in particular the practical procedures for their implementation remain somewhat unclear from the available Information the concerns of the League about possible discrimination of HIV positive members of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies remain', 'We have therefore decided to remain with our original position and not participate in the Conference', 'This decision was supported during the recent meeting of the European and North American Red Cross and Red Crescent Task Force on AIDS and is shared by many International nongovernmental organisations and a number of governments', 'We continue to urge US policy makers to make the necessary changes to their laws concerning people who are HIV positive in order to ensure that these laws and related regulations and procedures are based on sound public health principles and a caring and humanitarian approach to all people', 'Since the Conference is now less than a month away and in vt ew of the need to take a final decision about our participation', 'Irrespective of further changes in U S visa policy procedures the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies will not participate In the Vl th International Conference on AIDS', '22 May 1990 D

Conference\", 'It is very unfortunate that the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and many other NGC s will be absent from this Conference at a time when it is clearly so important that we develop partnerships and that all sectors and organisations cooperate and work together', 'It is clear to everyone that N QO s have played a very important role in the fight against AIDS their absence will I believe make this only a partial Conference and will have a serious negative affect on the outcome', 'The positive aspect of our withdrawal is that we have helped to bring about changes in the travel restrictions in the USA by providing support for those people within the USA who have fought for these changes', 'However despite some progress as of mid May there is still a great deal of confusion and lack of clarity about what these changes actually are and how they would be implemented in practice', 'We remain unconvinced that they significantly allay our concerns about potential discrimination of our members', 'We have also shown that as a community NGOs at least are still able to take moral stands on Issues of international and individual importance', 'And we have demonstrated that even though there are as many differences between NGOs as similarities on important matters we can stand together speak with one voice and act as a conscience for the International community', 'I wish you every success with your Conference and hope that it makes an important contribution to the fight against AIDS', 'However I also hope that we all le am from this experience and that such a situation will not be allowed to happen again', 'Exchange of ideas experiences and information is certainly essential if we are to combat the AIDS pandemic', 'But this will only be useful if advances can be put into practice and in order to do this we need to be able to ensure a caring and compassionate environment that is as free of discrimination as we would like it to be free of the virus and all the suffering that this virus causes', 'PB D VI DE 0 LC T 52 MICHAEL 23 05 90 pg N br 25 P fir Sten b ck Video mess ag e to the VIth INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AIDS San Francisco June

and unattended on the battle field of Solferino\", 'Since this time the Red Cross has devoted Itself to preventing and alleviating the suffering of vulnerable individuals and communities around the world', 'Irrespective of their race religion political or Ideological beliefs', 'Over the years the battle fields have changed', 'Today we have many new challenges such as economic recession environmental pollution and AIDS', 'The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies with National Societies in 149 countries around the world has been very active in the fight against AIDS', 'More than 100 Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies currently have AIDS related activities helping to prevent the spread of the virus and to provide care and support for people who are HIV positive people with AIDS their loved ones families and friends', 'We have also taken a very strong stand against the pandemic of discrimination that has followed the HIV AIDS pandemic both because we believe that discrimination is fundamentally wrong and also because from a public health poln t of v lew preventing discrimination is essential to preventing the spread of the virus', 'The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has participated in previous International Conferences on AIDS and as our involvement with the global effort has increased so has our involvement wil ii these Conferences', 'Last year at the Conference in Montreal we had more than forty representatives from thirty countries', 'This year however apart from this video message we will not be participating', 'We are not participating in the VIth International AIDS Conference because we are concerned that the current travel restrictions fdr people who wish to enter the United States of America may cause discrimination to members of the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies who are HIV positive and who attend the Conference', 'This Is obviously of great concern to us since we have consistently taken a strong stand against discrimination and since we have encouraged National Societies to Involve people who are HIV positive and people with AIDS in their programmes because of the Important perspective and experiences that they bring', 'Of course there are broader Issues at stake and we add our voice to the concern expressed by the public health authorities within the United States and by the World Health Organisation about any travel restrictions which single out people who are HIV positive since these will do nothing to prevent the spread of the disease but are likely to be punitive and discriminatory', 'Such measures merely reinforce the attitudes that fork against the control of this dreadful disease and Instead of preventing the spread they act as an obstacle to prevention', 'pg N

problems are not in this list for example expense and low cost access', 'This writeup is NOT for attribution unless I have an editorial role in the statement as a whole probably not feasible', 'Problems with Sixth International Conference All abstracts had to be submitted five months in advance', 'And wording on the abstract forms discouraged researchers from presenting their work elsewhere in the interval', 'As a result the Conference cast a five month shadow ahead of it a time of year when researchers are most reluctant to reveal to the public what they know', 'This five month gap would hopefully discourage researchers with critically important results from submitting them to the Conference at all as it would be objectionable to conceal important health information for months', 'Therefore the Conference policy on early submission and exclusivity almost guarantees that the most important advances will not be released at the Conference at all except perhaps by researchers who submitted an abstract on something else and obtained a speaker or poster slot', 'The inflexibility of the Sixth International has forced researchers with late breaking results to take them to the alternative conference Advanced Immune Discoveries Symposium at Le Meri dien Hotel a block away instead one example is the hyperthermia treatment recently tried in Atlanta', 'The International Conference also should be able to accommodate the most important fast developing stories', 'Conference participants cannot see the abstracts until they register', 'Then it is too late to read or s can the thousands of abstracts before meetings start', 'This lack of advance information makes pg N br 32 2 participants spend valuable Conference time figuring out what is going on instead of planning which posters to visit in advance', \"Over 1 500 abstracts were rejected this year compared to almost none rejected by last year ' International Conference in Montreal\", 'Yet no one today can be sure what will prove important in AIDS research', 'And abstracts are harder to judge than larger papers because less information is available', 'As a result decisions are unduly influenced by whether reviewers know the authors or know their reputations', 'Observations which do not fit with conventional theories are unlikely to survive this system despite the clear inadequacy of the existing understanding of AIDS', \"The abstract form for next year's conference in Florence Italy again requires a five month delay and exclusivity\", 'Therefore under current plans most if not all of the problems cited above are likely to be repeated next year', \"pg N br 33 STATEMENT OF JEAN MCGUIRE Executive Director AIDS Action Council AIDS June 22 1990 Action Council Today the AIDS Action Council

unconscionable that the corporation that is hosting the international conference on AIDS has helped to perpetuate the fear and stigma associated with HIV through their endorsement of this amendment', 'The Americans with Disabilities Act is currently pending in a conference between the House and Senate', 'It will provide federal anti discrimination protections to all people with disabilities

bringing the bill to conference both Houses endorsed the Chapman amendment which would limit protections available to food handlers who have contagious diseases', 'The amendment was directly lobbied by Dick Marriott treasurer of the National Restaurant Association and continues to be supported by the Marriott Corporation', 'Key votes on Chapman are expected early next week', 'The Chapman Amendment is unnecessary because the ADA already allows employers to enforce public health communicable disease standards in employment decisions', \"In promoting this amendment HIV was the target of the Congressional discussion and continues to be the focus of Marriott's concerns even though this is a communicable disease that is not trans miss able through food handling\", \"Marriott's position

boycott the Vl th International Conference on AIDS which will beheld in San Fr and sco June 20 24 The boycott is in response to the U 5 federal government's visa restrictions discriminating against people with HIV infection The temporary lifting of these restrictions is ii u u ff ici ent and does not alter boycott plans It is with mixed emotions that we announce our de dsi on to boycott said David Le mos Acting Executive Director of the NAMES Project While we realize the tremendous need for this annual forum for AIDS information we abhor the U S government's travel poli des affecting people with HIV infection The travel restrictions are in di red conflict with the NAMES Project's objective of working toward an immediate and compassionate response to the AIDS pandemic We therefore cannot in good cons den ce part id pate in a world vd de conference held in this country while these travel restrictions exist We also wish to emphasize that our action is prompted solely by these government poli des and is not intended to indicate any lack of support for the conference organizers As a result of withdrawal of NAMES Project participation the Quilt will not be displayed within

fully understand the decision of the NAMES Project to boycott However the Quilt's presence at j a st coi ference s both in Stockholm and Montreal added a poignant and much needed human dimension to the otherwise medical and scientific en vi ro run ent The Quilt will be conspicuous by its absence this year and very much missed The Quilt will however be on display in San Francisco at the end of June Conference attendees those visiting for the Lesbian and Gay Freedom Day Parade as well as residents will have the opportunity to visit the Quilt at Ft Mason's Festival Pavilion June 20 24 Sections of the Quilt will also be on display at the San Francisco International Airport as well as in the windows of several prominent downtown department stores It is our hop e that this boycott action along with the combined actions of many AIDS or gai uz at ions worldwide will send a strong message to Washington and that a tangible change will result continued Le mos If this is so and the visa regulations discriminating against people with HIV infection are lifted we look forward to full participation in the Vl th International Coi ference on AIDS The NAMES Project Foundation sj w ns or of the AIDS Memorial Quilt was established in June of 1987 in the heart of San Francisco's Castro district The Quilt began as a response by lesbians and gay men and their friends to the devastation of their community by AIDS From this beginning the organization reaches out to all those affected by the epidemic Its goals are to graphically illustrate the impact and human toll of AIDS to provide a powerful expression of love grief pain and anger to those who must confront AIDS in their daily lives and to raise the desperately needed funds to support p e ople living with AIDS and their loved ones as the epidemic continues unabated pg N br 2 The Quilt An International AIDS Memorial May 10 1990 As June 20 and the start of the Vl th International Conference on AIDS draw closer it is apparent that the United States Government will not make substantial changes in immigration and travel policies towards people with H TV AIDS As the l x y c ott with drawl of the Conference grows in size and importance so too does the danger that the voices of people with AIDS and HIV will be lost at the conference We hope that together we can help prevent this from happening The NAMES Project will be having several displays of the International AIDS Memorial Quilt all over San Francisco during the month of June The largest display will beat Fort Mason a museum complex June 21 24 with of over 3000 memorial panels The first display in San Francisco for over 18 months with a very high attend en ce from all of the city's communities it will be the focus of most of our time and energy Panels will be disp aly ed at the San Francisco International Airport from June 1 and in most of the major department store windows downtown as well While we will not be displaying panels inside of the conference these display venues and our location in San Francisco give susan opportunity to publicize the boycotting organizations and the reason behind the boycott Our proposal to you is that you endorse the attached statements each to be use data different site We intend to have the statements on a large sign in the airport with a display of primarily international panels a tour C i lt display in Fort Mason and inside of the Conference itself We have been in contact with the Vl th In tem at ional conference organizers who are sympathetic to our position and agreed to put up a statement if we provide it If any of you have strong suggestions about what to do we would like to hear them Please keep in mind that we already have a lot going on at that time and cannot undertake any schemes which require a lot of time or people Please pass this statement along to other boycotting organizations as we do not have addresses for all of them It would be great if you could contact all of the

this June 20 24 in San Francisco Calif NG LT F is encouraging activists to continue pressuring the government to repeal the policies NG LT F is the first reported national U S gay and lesbian civil rights organization to boycott the conference The Task Force joins more than 35 national and international organizations that have chosen not to participate in the gathering including the National Association of People with AIDS the International League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies the Canadian AIDS Society Shanti Project and the Names Project International AIDS Memorial Quilt NG LT F's decision to boycott the conference was made by its board of directors at the Nashville Tenn board meeting on March 18 NG LT F leaders said the group would rescind its boycott only if travel restrictions on people with AIDS and gays and lesbians are lifted We believe the U S government policy of denying entry to gay men and lesbians and people with AIDS and HIV is morally reprehensible said veteran NG LT F board member Rick Rudy Rudy an openly gay person with AIDS is also president of the Bay Area based High Tech Gays which is strongly considering joining the boycott We do not feel the conference can accomplish its tasks if those most concerned are prohibited from attending Under current law any person testing HIV positive may be excluded from the U S including tourists refugees people seeking asylum and legalization students persons with special visas to teach or conduct research as well as persons who have lived legally in the U S as students laborers or permanent residents

inn and other locations HIV was added to the list of restricted communicable diseases including tuberculosis syphilis and gonorrhea by an amendment offered by Sen Jesse Helms to the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1987 Waivers for some individuals with AIDS or HIV may be granted for limited or restricted entry into the U S Following considerable media criticism and pressure from AIDS and other groups the Immigration and Naturalization Service in January announced it would stop marking passports of those with HIV infection who are granted waivers to enter the country NG LT F condemns any prohibitions on immigration visitation and naturalization of HIV infected persons as well as restrictions on lesbians and gay men said Ur va shi V aid NG LT F executive director AIDS is not imported into the U S There must be no travel restrictions on foreigners with AIDS or HIV or on gay men and lesbians The U S has more than 121 000 cases of AIDS by far the greatest number of reported cases of any country in the world V aid pointed out that the World Health Organization the Presidential Commission on the HIV epidemic the National AIDS Commission and other groups have rejected restrictions on HIV positive persons as unnecessary counterproductive and a waste of resources Organizers of the VI International Conference of AIDS say the conference stands to lose several thousand participants if the current immigration policies are enforced President George Bush has declined an invitation to speak at the gathering which is traditionally opened by the head of state of the host country In addition to fighting discriminatory AIDS policies NG LT F is involved in lobbying for passage of legislation that would repeal anti gay and lesbian immigration law A bill offered by openly gay Representative Barney Frank would change existing law that prohibits foreigners from visiting or applying for permanent residence in the U S based on their sexual orientation NG LT F is the oldest

shi V aid executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force NG LT F who stood up during the presentation and urged the President to do more for people with AIDS Bush spoke to a gathering of about 400 business and labor leaders at a conference sponsored by the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS held at the Crystal City Gateway Marriott Hotel just outside Washington The speech was extensively covered by major national and international media During the speech V aid who s at in front of the President stood and held up a sign that read Talk Is Cheap AIDS Funding Is Not and Remember Gay People With AIDS She then challenged Bush directly saying Mr President you don't understand We need your leadership We need more than one speech every 14 months We need more funding for AIDS education research and prevention We need you to end the discriminatory immigration policy Secret Service agents instructed V aid to remove the sign and s it down But a few minutes later V aid again stood to address the President who up to that point in his speech had not revealed any new substantive Administration initiatives for fighting the epidemic V aid was then escorted out of the hotel and told if she reentered she would be arrested Bush paused during his speech to address V aid saying Let me say something about this I can understand the concern that these people feel And I hope if we do nothing else by coming here I can help them understand that not only you care but we care too During his speech Bush urged compassion for people with AIDS He mentioned education AIDS babies confidentiality the war on drugs and praised Allstate Company Fortune Magazine and General Motors for fighting the disease Among other things Bush touted the Administration's response to AIDS more pg N br 13 The epidemic is having a major impact on our health care I system said Bush The Federal response is unprecedented Bush renewed his support for the Americans With Disabilities ' Act which he said must be immediately passed to ban discrimination against people with AIDS and HIV It is commendable that the President mentioned anti discrimination protections said V aid after the speech And his rhetoric was certainly more compassionate than anything former President Reagan ever said But one speech does not equal leadership Photo opportunities and sound bites on compassion are not substitutes for public health policy and political courage In particular V aid criticized the White House's AIDS funding proposal for 1991 During his speech Bush said the Administration had asked Congress for 3 5 billion in 1991 for AIDS But AIDS advocates sharply criticized and rebuked that figure saying after Medicaid and Medicare entitlements Defense Department testing costs and other miscellaneous expenses are factored out the actual Bush AIDS budget request for 1991 for Labor Health and Humans Services expenditures is 1 75 billion The day before the President's address NG LT F's V aid testified before the Senate Appropriations committee in support of increased federal AIDS funding V aid on behalf of the National Organizations Responding to AIDS NORA of which NG LT F is a member asked for 2 8 billion to meet anticipated HIV prevention care and research needs in 1991 The NORA proposal emphasizes immediate impact aid to relieve those communities hardest hit by the epidemic What is missing from the President's picture of AIDS asked V aid An end to punitive and harmful immigration visitation and permanent residency laws that discriminate against foreigners with AIDS and HIV Increased funding of AIDS research prevention and care programs Affordable health care for all Americans Access to promising drug therapies Acknowledgement that the gay community which comprises more than 65 percent of total AIDS cases continues to suffer discrimination stigma ti z ation and government negligence And a real action plan for fighting the nation's health crisis OUT a D C based direct action group joined the New York and D C chapters of ACT UP to stage a protest at the hotel during the speech In order to enter the hotel's conference site attendees most of them corporate executives and business leaders had to walk through a human gauntlet of about 80 AIDS activists lining both sides of the hallway Activists carried signs that said among other things Wake Up

20 1990 Dear Executive Director We are writing to request your help with two needs of the Sixth International Conference on AIDS our delegate host and volunteer programs As part of its commitment to assure the role cf HIV infected individuals and community based organizations in its proceedings the Conference is distributing 375 passes to HIV infected people otherwise unable to afford the 475 registration cost of attending providing low cost exhibit space for 150 non profit AIDS organizations and distributing Conference passes to these exhibitors To further assist delegates in these programs the Conference is undertaking a project to develop a list of free housing offered by San Francisco residents during the period of the Conference We enclose a form that we hope you will circulate among staff and volunteers who maybe able to have a Conference delegate stay in their home during the period of approximately June 19 to 24 The reverse side of the form describes the way the program works after submitting a Host Registration We hope that the delegate host program becomes a visible way for San Franciscans to show their hospitality to participants in the Sixth International Conference on AIDS and a means of assuring that Conference participants are afforded greater access to San Francisco's model response to AIDS As you can imagine the logistics and staffing required to guarantee the success of the Conference are extensive Hundreds of volunteers will be needed both before and during the Conference to assist in carrying out a full range of tasks to assure that this meeting fulfills the needs of delegates in their roles responding to the AIDS epidemic Volunteers will be needed to assist with office work act as hosts and monitors assist in Conference set up and tear down assist as runners for media representatives and for many other tasks We are certainly sensitive to the fact that many community based organizations are themselves in need of increased volunteer supp rat We are asking if it is in keeping with your needs if you would agree to circulate the attached volunteer registration form within your organization We hope that as with the Delegate Host Program the efforts of volunteers will exemplify the unique com miu nen t of Bay Area residents to the fight against AIDS If you have any questions about the delegate host program we hope you will contact Dana Van G order on our staff Dave Brack eris available to answer questions re garc fin g volunteers Dave will also be planning to contact you within the coming weeks Thank you very much

Host Program is to enable HIV infected people and representatives of community based AIDS organizations to attend the Sixth International Conference on AIDS who would otherwise be unable to afford to stay in San Francisco In many cases these Conference delegates will be people to whom the Conference has pr ovid free registration The Delegate Host Program asks San Francisco residents to provide free housing to delegates of the Sixth International Conference on AIDS from approximately the period of June 19 to 24 The Conference wi U recruit a list of San Fianc is can s willing to offer space to Conference delegates Then we will receive applications from delegates for donated housing Our computer will do its best to match hosts to guests Once the computer has done its part we will mail the name of one host to one guest The guest will be responsible for calling the host to assure that this match up is satisfactory Unless the Conference office hears from the guest that this matchup is NOT satisfactory we will assume that we have taken care of this particular delegate and move on to the next From that point on all details about the delegate's stay should be arranged between the delegate and his or her guest We hope that people will work together to negotiate details regarding the length of their stay pick up at the airport if possible and other arrangements Please contact Steve Tiger

U S immigration laws It is inexcusable to have such restrictions for which there is no sound public health rationale on the hooks We hope the boycott sends a strong signal to the Bush administration that this policy is unacceptable Ho del had planned to present a paper during one of the conference's Social Science and Policy oral sessions titled ' Buyers ' Clubs ' and the Legit i miz ation of the

CRESCENT SOCIETIES ' POSITION ON ATTENDANCE AT THE VIth INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AIDS San Francisco June 20 24 1990 The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies decided in N oven ber 1989 to withdraw from participating in the Vl th International Conference on AIDS The reasons for this withdrawal were clearly outlined at the time and centred around our concern that the U S visa policy for people who are HIV positive might cause discrimination to HIV positive members of Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies who wished to attend the Conference A second statement was issued from the League Secretariat In January 1990 following some revisions In the application of the visa waiver procedure for people who are HIV positive and who wished to attend the Vl th International AIDS Conference Despite the welcome changes it was considered that they did not significantly alter the potential for discrimination of members of National Societies and our position on attending the Conference remained unaltered There have been further recent changes to the visa waiver procedure and once again we would like to express our solidarity and support for all those people within the United States of America who have helped to bring about these changes Including the American Red Cross Although the exact details of the changes and in particular the practical procedures for their implementation remain somewhat unclear from the available Information the concerns of the League about possible discrimination of HIV positive members of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies remain We have therefore decided to remain with our original position and not participate in the Conference This decision was supported during the recent meeting of the European and North American Red Cross and Red Crescent Task Force on AIDS and is shared by many International nongovernmental organisations and a number of governments We continue to urge US policy makers to make the necessary changes to their laws concerning people who are HIV positive in order to ensure that these laws and related regulations and procedures are based on sound public health principles and a caring and humanitarian approach to all people Since the Conference is now less than a month away and in vt ew of the need to take a final decision about our participation Irrespective of further changes in U S visa policy procedures the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies will not participate In the Vl th International Conference on AIDS 22 May 1990 D BDS F AID LC T 52 MICHAEL pg N br 24 May 23 90 9 12 0000 LI CROSS GENE U fl SUIT Z TEL 41 22 330395 PPl GE 05 r 7 t ' c Unfortunately there is a negative side to our withdrawal from this Conference It is very unfortunate that the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and many other NGC s will be absent from this Conference at a time when it is clearly so important that we develop partnerships and that all sectors and organisations cooperate and work together It is clear to everyone that N QO s have played a very important role in the fight against AIDS their absence will I believe make this only a partial Conference and will have a serious negative affect on the outcome The positive aspect of our withdrawal is that we have helped to bring about changes in the travel restrictions in the USA by providing support for those people within the USA who have fought for these changes However despite some progress as of mid May there is still a great deal of confusion and lack of clarity about what these changes actually are and how they would be implemented in practice We remain unconvinced that they significantly allay our concerns about potential discrimination of our members We have also shown that as a community NGOs at least are still able to take moral stands on Issues of international and individual importance And we have demonstrated that even though there are as many differences between NGOs as similarities on important matters we can stand together speak with one voice and act as a conscience for the International community I wish you every success with your Conference and hope that it makes an important contribution to the fight against AIDS However I also hope that we all le am from this experience and that such a situation will not be allowed to happen again Exchange of ideas experiences and information is certainly essential if we are to combat the AIDS pandemic But this will only be useful if advances can be put into practice and in order to do this we need to be able to ensure a caring and compassionate environment that is as free of discrimination as we would like it to be free of the virus and all the suffering that this virus causes PB D VI DE 0 LC T 52 MICHAEL 23 05 90 pg N br 25 P fir Sten b ck Video mess ag e to the VIth INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AIDS San Francisco June 20 24 1990 For the past 125 years the symbol of the Red Cross has stood for compassion and humanity It was born out of one man's horror and concern about the wounded and dying who lay un cared for and unattended on the battle field of Solferino Since this time the Red Cross has devoted Itself to preventing and alleviating the suffering of vulnerable individuals and communities around the world Irrespective of their race religion political or Ideological beliefs Over the years the battle fields have changed Today we have many new challenges such as economic recession environmental pollution and AIDS The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies with National Societies in 149 countries around the world has been very active in the fight against AIDS More than 100 Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies currently have AIDS related activities helping to prevent the spread of the virus and to provide care and support for people who are HIV positive people with AIDS their loved ones families and friends We have also taken a very strong stand against the pandemic of discrimination that has followed the HIV AIDS pandemic both because we believe that discrimination is fundamentally wrong and also because from a public health poln t of v lew preventing discrimination is essential to preventing the spread of the virus The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has participated in previous International Conferences on AIDS and as our involvement with the global effort has increased so has our involvement wil ii these Conferences Last year at the Conference in Montreal we had more than forty representatives from thirty countries This year however apart from this video message we will not be participating We are not participating in the VIth International AIDS Conference because we are concerned that the current travel restrictions fdr people who wish to enter the United States of America may cause discrimination to members of the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies who are HIV positive and who attend the Conference This Is obviously of great concern to us since we have consistently taken a strong stand against discrimination and since we have encouraged National Societies to Involve people who are HIV positive and people with AIDS in their programmes because of the Important perspective and experiences that they bring Of course there are broader Issues at stake and we add our voice to the concern expressed by the public health authorities within the United States and by the World Health Organisation about any travel restrictions which single out people who are HIV positive since these will do nothing to prevent the spread of the disease but are likely to be punitive and discriminatory Such measures merely reinforce the attitudes that fork against the control of this dreadful disease and Instead of preventing the spread they act as an obstacle to prevention pg N br 26 i Conference Boycott Gathers Steam A number of other Other AIDS service by Kevin Farrell organizations from Europe

I yi n to Kevin Farrell from John James 861 2432 date 6 19 I i Enclosed Abstract form for Florence conference next year Here are my points about problems with the Conference Many other problems are not in this list for example expense and low cost access This writeup is NOT for attribution unless I have an editorial role in the statement as a whole probably not feasible Problems with Sixth International Conference All abstracts had to be submitted five months in advance And wording on the abstract forms discouraged researchers from presenting their work elsewhere in the interval As a result the Conference cast a five month shadow ahead of it a time of year when researchers are most reluctant to reveal to the public what they know This five month gap would hopefully discourage researchers with critically important results from submitting them to the Conference at all as it would be objectionable to conceal important health information for months Therefore the Conference policy on early submission and exclusivity almost guarantees that the most important advances will not be released at the Conference at all except perhaps by researchers who submitted an abstract on something else and obtained a speaker or poster slot The inflexibility of the Sixth International has forced researchers with late breaking results to take them to the alternative conference Advanced Immune Discoveries Symposium at Le Meri dien Hotel a block away instead one example is the hyperthermia treatment recently tried in Atlanta The International Conference also should be able to accommodate the most important fast developing stories Conference participants cannot see the abstracts until they register Then it is too late to read or s can the thousands of abstracts before meetings start This lack of advance information makes pg N br 32 2 participants spend valuable Conference time figuring out what is going on instead of planning which posters to visit in advance Over 1 500 abstracts were rejected this year compared to almost none rejected by last year ' International Conference in Montreal Yet no one today can be sure what will prove important in AIDS research And abstracts are harder to judge than larger papers because less information is available As a result decisions are unduly influenced by whether reviewers know the authors or know their reputations Observations which do not fit with conventional theories are unlikely to survive this system despite the clear inadequacy of the existing understanding of AIDS The abstract form for next year's conference in Florence Italy again requires a five month delay and exclusivity Therefore under current plans most if not all of the problems cited above are likely to be repeated next year pg N br 33 STATEMENT OF JEAN MCGUIRE Executive Director AIDS Action Council AIDS June 22 1990 Action Council Today the AIDS Action Council is launching a boycott of the San Francisco Marriott Hotel food services to protest the Corporation's support of the Chapman amendment to the Americans with Disabilities ADA Act It is unconscionable that the corporation that is hosting the international conference on AIDS has helped to perpetuate the fear and stigma associated with HIV through their endorsement of this amendment The Americans with Disabilities Act is currently pending in a conference between the House and Senate It will provide federal anti discrimination protections to all people with disabilities including those v it h AIDS and H TV infection This is the kind of discrimination protection the public health community has been calling for since the earliest stages of this epidemic In bringing the bill to conference both Houses endorsed the Chapman amendment which would limit protections available to food handlers who have contagious diseases The amendment was directly lobbied by Dick Marriott treasurer of the National Restaurant Association and continues to be supported by the Marriott Corporation Key votes on Chapman are expected early next week The Chapman Amendment is unnecessary because the ADA already allows employers to enforce public health communicable disease standards in employment decisions In promoting this amendment HIV was the target of the Congressional discussion and continues to be the focus of Marriott's concerns even though this is a communicable disease that is not trans miss able through food handling Marriott's position on this amendment contradicts its own internal employment policies which quite liberally guarantee the rights of workers with HIV This makes their public stance and lobbying efforts that much more reprehensible Our challenge to Marriott today is to join us in making their own workplace guarantees the law of the land As the ADA conference report goes to a final vote next week Marriott has the opportunity to lead corporate America in good HIV public policy or to be a part of continuing to perpetuate irrational fears

CHA AN AMENDMENT OPPOSE HIV DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FOOD HANDLERS BOYCOTT MARRIOTT FOOD SERVICES Congress is considering allowing disc ri in mati on against people with H TV infection who handle food on their jobs the Chapman amendment to the Americans with Disabilities Act This amendment is based on unfounded fears and runs counter to all public health guidelines The Marriott Corporation one of the largest hotel corporations in the United States has supported this limitation Marriott is the headquarters site for the Sixth International Conference on AIDS which seeks to translate sound scientific findings into reasonable public policy By refusing to take a strong stand against the food handler amendment the Chapman Amendment Marriott continues to support irrational perceptions about H TV transmission that were resolved long ago HIV is not transmitted via food handling The Marriott has chosen to ignore this fact Until the Marriott Corporation joins in opposing these infringements on the rights of people with HIV we urge conference participants to boycott all food services restaurants and room service at the Marriott To support the boycott Do not order room service or eat in

executives and researchers including those participating in the Sixth International Conference on AIDS have locked us out of decisions affecting our lives We demand access to all information affecting our lives We demand a voice in every step of the process from the inception of an idea for research through the actual research up until the idea becomes a reality Furthermore we demand 1 Access to quality health care to all people worldwide regardless of ability to pay Health care is a right 2 Access to effective research programs for AIDS HIV and other Immune System Disorders These programs must be designed to save the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people worldwide who are expected to die from AIDS in the next three years 3 Unbiased information on and access to alternative treatments including vitamin and herbal therapies acupuncture homeopathy and other non pharmaceutical treatments To this end alternative treatments must be included in official conferences and AIDS service referrals These treatments must be covered by private and government health insurance plans We have a right to make informed choices among all possible treatments 4 The expansion and or initiation of studies of disease progression and detection in groups who may have a different response to HIV because of biochemical or cultural differences including women tr an sexual s injection drug users children adolescents and people of color 5 An end to placebo controlled trials for treatments of life threatening conditions For many people clinical trials are the only form of healthcare available Placebo trials are immoral because they prevent treatment and access to healthcare 6 Worldwide access for all People with Immune System Disorders to data A n international databank to make available all medical information related to immune system disorders must be created This includes all data concerning drugs and treatments especially basic bio chemical research and the initiation of clinical trials Additionally there must be public access to all medical and research information regarding AIDS and the cross referencing of data and treatment information between AIDS and other Immune System Disorders such as Cytomegalovirus Epstein Barr Virus and Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome etc Also we demand the creation of an international database on the full prevalence of all AIDS complications pg N br 42 7 Civil rights for all People with Immune System Disorders We need anti discrimination legislation protecting jobs housing and access to services full legal recognition of lesbian gay and bisexual relationships respect fortran sexual rights anonymous and absolutely confidential HIV antibody testing as well as pre and post test counseling housing that meets the medical needs of People with Immune System Disorders substance abuse treatment the same standard of care and treatment for prisoners as for the general population the right of people faced with a life threatening illness to choose treatments they deem beneficial for themselves to stop mandatory testing and quarantine under any circumstances to end all restrictions on the international movement or immigration of people with HIV to end the forced sterilization of women enrolling in research protocols and to stop research with prisoners under duress or without informed consent 8 The legislation and regulations of all governments must reflect the fact that HIV is not commonly contagious Casual contact presents no threat of infection and irrational fears of transmission must be fought 9 Access to international education programs outlining comprehensive sex information affirming and supportive of all sexual orientations in culturally sensitive ways and describing safer sex needle hygiene and other means of preventing Sexually Transmitted Diseases HIV and other viruses 10 Access to health care All governments and all international health organizations must treat AIDS and other Immune System Disorders positively and aggressively Ensuring access and availability of treatment must be part of the social and moral obligations of governments to their citizens AIDS research and healthcare funding must not compete with other pressing healthcare priorities The entire biomedical research budget must be drastically increased to meet the world's healthcare crisis In the U S all branches of the government must provide leadership and a comprehensive coordinated AIDS research education and prevention effort with enhanced funding to keep pace with the epidemic Primary health care provisions must be comprehensive providing culturally sensitive care and information for the individual and her his family Recognition that in most parts of the world poverty is a critical co factor in immune suppression Thus industrialized nations must establish an internationally developed fund to assist poor and developing countries to meet their healthcare responsibilities including the provision of condoms facilities for a clean blood supply and adequate supplies of sterile needles as well as a full range of medical services and treatments and educational materials In addition conversion of military spending worldwide to medical health and basic social services is essential pg N br 43 11 Access to an international health organization seriously dedicated to combatting immune System Disorders We condemn the World Health Organization WHO for failing to coordinate an international response to the AIDS epidemic and for not addressing Immune System Disorders We demand an internationally coordinated effort to halt AIDS and other immune System Disorders to provide treatment for all people infected with immune System Disorders and to advocate for those who are discriminated against and oppressed due to their immune status 12 Participatory power in the decision making process regarding research and treatment Restructure the AIDS Clinical Trial Group ACT G of the U S National Institutes of Health decision making The ACT G Executive Committee must be restructured to include representatives of all ACT G committees and from the communities affected by AIDS We demand that the ACT G Reveal conflicts of interest All ACT G funded investigators must make public details of all financial and historical links they maintain with pharmaceutical sponsors They must abstain from the selection process where these sponsors ' drugs are involved ' Focus on developing NEW treatments The ACT G must research all promising new treatments including non drug treatments such as Passive Immuno Therapy in small technology intensive Phase i il safety activity studies to get new effective treatments out the door Then pharmaceutical sponsors and community based groups can conduct larger treatment trials Focus on the entire range of AIDS morbidity and mortality Over 90 percent of AIDS death are caused by opportunistic infections Ol s but just 17 percent of ACT G subjects so far have been in 01 trials The ACT G must immediately start trials designed to prevent or treat the most serious and widespread Ol s CM V MAI fungal infections to xo plasm os is crypto spor i dios is the HIV associated cancers KS and lymphomas and chlamydia and other vaginal Ol s that occur in women living with AIDS Diversify research priorities In the next two years the ACT G must make the five major opportunistic infections treatable or preventable must improve quality of treatments for AIDS associated cancers must intensify research into rebuilding the immune system including fetal tissue research and must initiate a good faith effort to analyze alternatives to pharmaceutical therapy including holistic non pharmaceutical and nutritional approaches Initiate flexible innovative multi agent combination trials The future of HIV treatment lies with combination therapy It's time to initiate nationwide combination trials with alternating or sequential anti HIV agents plus immune rebuilding treatments and multi opportunistic infection prophylaxis pg N br 44 End medical apartheid open trials to ALL HIV infected people ACT G trials must be open to the entire spectrum of the HIV infected population Exclusion criteria must be compensated for by open enrollment safety treatment trials for all AIDS complications Enrollment of underrepresented groups including women African Americans Latinos as Native Americans Asians Pacific Islanders and present and former drug users must be enhanced through the provision of health care transportation subsidies childcare and addiction treatment Streamline pediatric treatment access The ACT G must design treatment trials for children and adolescents as soon as treatments prove safe in adult Phase I studies Provide state of the art clinical care within AIDS clinical trials ACT G trials must provide participants with state of the art therapies as they evolve Rapidly translate results into clinical practice NI AID's Division of AIDS must establish an Office of HIV AIDS Clinical Care to provide state of the art treatment guidelines and to oversee the rapid translation of trial results into clinical practice Conduct research where the need is greatest When the ACT U grants are renewed research sites should be established in high incidence areas now un served AIDS research and healthcare need to be provided together in all high HIV incidence areas ' Funding for the various ACT G sites should be apportioned on the basis of the needs of the community served and the willingness of the Principal Investigators to comply with the above demands 13 Access to ail government functions affecting the AIDS crisis All NIH AIDS meetings including those of NI AID its Division of AIDS ACT G conferences and core committees the AIDS Clinical Drug Development Committee and the National Cooperative Drug Discovery Groups must be open internationally to People with Immune System Disorders including activists and the press 14 Alteration of the U S Centers for Disease Control's CDC definition of AIDS to reflect the full spectrum and diversity of AIDS and HIV related diseases The current definition of AIDS is obsolete It denies treatment care and social services to poor people who do not fit their definition of AIDS 11 does not include opportunistic infections that affect children adolescents women people of color and injection drug users As a result we are denied access to life saving treatments It also denies early intervention therapy to a symptomatic HIV infected people The current definition is designed to under count the full extent of the pandemic resulting in a lack of funding pg N br 45 I 15 Decriminalization of needle possession and immediate implementation of government funded programs to provide effective appropriate treatment on demand and distribution of free sterile needles for injection drug users 16 Access to all AIDS conferences for People with Immune System

P IS D must be given free entry into the conferences P IS D from non industrialized countries must be given travel scholarships to attend P IS D must be represented on all conference panels pg N br 46 NO MORE WORD S WE WANT ACTION Thus far during this conference ACT UP has made many points without disrupting the exchange of scientific information However today's scheduled speech by Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr Louis B Sullivan is not a scientific presentation After 10 years of Bush Reagan rhetoric on AIDS we will no longer tolerate words without action You will not hear Louis Sullivan today THE BUSH SULLIVAN CRIMES THE We have to WORDS fight the disease not the people with the disease THE ACTION HIV positive individuals are denied entry to and deported from the U S A We

Every time there is a promising treatment opportunity we pursue it THE ACTION ACT UP has identified over 99 drugs that have shown promise as possible AIDS treatments VIRTUALLY NONE OF THESE ARE SLATED FOR GOVERNMENT TRIALS THE WORDS Clean needle exchange programs are a viable option in control of the spread of HIV among IV drug users THE ACTION Just as Louis Sullivan has abandoned women by flip flopping on abortion so he has abandoned IV drug users by flip flopping on needle exchange and bleach distribution programs leaving them to die THE WORDS I want a kinder gentler nation THE ACTION The

care WE INVITE YOU TO JOIN US IN PROTEST STAND AND TURN YOUR BACK ON SULLIVAN AND HIS MEANINGLESS RHETORIC pg N br 47 Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr Louis B Sullivan as the highest ranking government official and a person of color has failed to voice the concerns of communities of color regarding the spread of HIV infection People of color are disproportionately over represented in the

Memorial Quilt was established in June of 1987 in the heart of San Francisco's Castro district The Quilt began as a response by lesbians and gay men and their friends to the devastation of their community by AIDS From this beginning the organization reaches out to all those affected by the epidemic Its goals are to graphically illustrate the impact and human toll of AIDS to provide a powerful expression of love grief pain and anger to those who must confront AIDS in their daily lives and to raise the desperately needed funds to support p e ople living with AIDS and their loved ones as the

March 20 1990 The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force NG LT F will boycott the VI International Conference on AIDS because of the U S Government's discriminatory AIDS and gay and lesbian immigration and visitation policies In addition NG LT F is calling on its more than 17 000 members nationwide as well as other gay and lesbian organizations and individuals to boycott the conference scheduled for this June 20 24 in San Francisco Calif NG LT F is encouraging activists to continue pressuring the government to repeal the policies NG LT F is the first reported national U S gay and lesbian civil rights organization to boycott the conference The Task Force joins more than 35 national and international organizations that have chosen not to participate in the gathering including the National Association of People with AIDS the International League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies the Canadian AIDS Society Shanti Project and the Names Project International AIDS Memorial Quilt NG LT F's decision to boycott the conference was made by its board of directors at the Nashville Tenn board meeting on March 18 NG LT F leaders said the group would rescind its boycott only if travel restrictions on people with AIDS and gays and lesbians are lifted We believe the U S government policy of denying entry to gay men and lesbians and people with AIDS and HIV is morally reprehensible said veteran NG LT F board member Rick Rudy Rudy an openly gay person with AIDS is also president of the Bay Area based High Tech Gays which is strongly considering joining the boycott We do not feel the conference can accomplish its tasks if those most concerned are prohibited from attending Under current law any person testing HIV positive may be excluded from the U S including tourists refugees people seeking asylum and legalization students persons with special visas to teach or conduct research as well as persons who have lived legally in the U S as students laborers or permanent residents and are now seeking naturalization as citizens more pg N br 11 Individuals coming from outside the U S can be denied temporary admission or detained at the border which has occurred in Minneapolis M inn and other locations HIV was added to the list of restricted communicable diseases including tuberculosis syphilis and gonorrhea by an amendment offered by Sen Jesse Helms to the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1987 Waivers for some individuals with AIDS or HIV may be granted for limited or restricted entry into the U S Following considerable media criticism and pressure from AIDS and other groups the Immigration and Naturalization Service in January announced it would stop marking passports of those with HIV infection who are granted waivers to enter the country NG LT F condemns any prohibitions on immigration visitation and naturalization of HIV infected persons as well as restrictions on lesbians and gay men said Ur va shi V aid NG LT F executive director AIDS is not imported into the U S There must be no travel restrictions on foreigners with AIDS or HIV or on gay men and lesbians The U S has more than 121 000 cases of AIDS by far the greatest number of reported cases of any country in the world V aid pointed out that the World Health Organization the Presidential Commission on the HIV epidemic the National AIDS Commission and other groups have rejected restrictions on HIV positive persons as unnecessary counterproductive and a waste of resources Organizers of the VI International Conference of AIDS say the conference stands to lose several thousand participants if the current immigration policies are enforced President George Bush has declined an invitation to speak at the gathering which is traditionally opened by the head of state of the host country In addition to fighting discriminatory AIDS policies NG LT F is involved in lobbying for passage of legislation that would repeal anti gay and lesbian immigration law A bill offered by openly gay Representative Barney Frank would change existing law that prohibits foreigners from visiting or applying for permanent residence in the U S based on their sexual orientation NG LT F is the oldest and preeminent national gay and lesbian civil rights organization in the U S Founded in 1973 the Task Force fights for full equality for lesbians and gay men and responsible federal AIDS policies pr

executive director protests bush policies at presidential aids address Washington D C March 29 1990 President George Bush's first major address on the AIDS health crisis was interrupted today by Ur va shi V aid executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force NG LT F who stood up during the presentation and urged the President to do more for people with AIDS Bush spoke to a gathering of about 400 business and labor leaders at a conference sponsored by the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS held at the Crystal City Gateway Marriott Hotel just outside Washington The speech was extensively covered by major national and international media During the speech V aid who s at in front of the President stood and held up a sign that read Talk Is Cheap AIDS Funding Is Not and Remember Gay People With AIDS She then challenged Bush directly saying Mr President you don't understand We need your leadership We need more than one speech every 14 months We need more funding for AIDS education research and prevention We need you to end the discriminatory immigration policy Secret Service agents instructed V aid to remove the sign and s it down But a few minutes later V aid again stood to address the President who up to that point in his speech had not revealed any new substantive Administration initiatives for fighting the epidemic V aid was then escorted out of the hotel and told if she reentered she would be arrested Bush paused during his speech to address V aid saying Let me say something about this I can understand the concern that these people feel And I hope if we do nothing else by coming here I can help them understand that not only you care but we care too During his speech Bush urged compassion for people with AIDS He mentioned education AIDS babies confidentiality the war on drugs and praised Allstate Company Fortune Magazine and General Motors for fighting the disease Among other things Bush touted the Administration's response to AIDS more pg N br 13 The epidemic is having a major impact on our health care I system said Bush The Federal response is unprecedented Bush renewed his support for the Americans With Disabilities ' Act which he said must be immediately passed to ban discrimination against people with AIDS and HIV It is commendable that the President mentioned anti discrimination protections said V aid after the speech And his rhetoric was certainly more compassionate than anything former President Reagan ever said But one speech does not equal leadership Photo opportunities and sound bites on compassion are not substitutes for public health policy and political courage In particular V aid criticized the White House's AIDS funding proposal for 1991 During his speech Bush said the Administration had asked Congress for 3 5 billion in 1991 for AIDS But AIDS advocates sharply criticized and rebuked that figure saying after Medicaid and Medicare entitlements Defense Department testing costs and other miscellaneous expenses are factored out the actual Bush AIDS budget request for 1991 for Labor Health and Humans Services expenditures is 1 75 billion The day before the President's address NG LT F's V aid testified before the Senate Appropriations committee in support of increased federal AIDS funding V aid on behalf of the National Organizations Responding to AIDS NORA of which NG LT F is a member asked for 2 8 billion to meet anticipated HIV prevention care and research needs in 1991 The NORA proposal emphasizes immediate impact aid to relieve those communities hardest hit by the epidemic What is missing from the President's picture of AIDS asked V aid An end to punitive and harmful immigration visitation and permanent residency laws that discriminate against foreigners with AIDS and HIV Increased funding of AIDS research prevention and care programs Affordable health care for all Americans Access to promising drug therapies Acknowledgement that the gay community which comprises more than 65 percent of total AIDS cases continues to suffer discrimination stigma ti z ation and government negligence And a real action plan for fighting the nation's health crisis OUT a D C based direct action group joined the New York and D C chapters of ACT UP to stage a protest at the hotel during the speech In order to enter the hotel's conference site attendees most of them corporate executives and business leaders had to walk through a human gauntlet of about 80 AIDS activists lining both sides of the hallway Activists carried signs that said among other things Wake Up George Where's The Plan and Nine Years of AIDS 80 000 Dead One Lousy Speech A National Disgrace pg N br 14 SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AIDS 'S AN ' FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA USA 20 24 JUNE 1990 March 20 1990 Dear Executive Director We are writing to request your help with two needs of the Sixth International Conference on AIDS our delegate host and volunteer programs As part of its commitment to assure the role cf HIV infected individuals and community based organizations in its proceedings the Conference is distributing 375 passes to HIV infected people otherwise unable to afford the 475 registration cost of attending providing low cost exhibit space for 150 non profit AIDS organizations and distributing Conference passes to these exhibitors To further assist delegates in these programs the Conference is undertaking a project to develop a list of free housing offered by San Francisco residents during the period of the Conference We enclose a form that we hope you will circulate among staff and volunteers who maybe able to have a Conference delegate stay in their home during the period of approximately June 19 to 24 The reverse side of the form describes the way the program works after submitting a Host Registration We hope that the delegate host program becomes a visible way for San Franciscans to show their hospitality to participants in the Sixth International Conference on AIDS and a means of assuring that Conference participants are afforded greater access to San Francisco's model response to AIDS As you can imagine the logistics and staffing required to guarantee the success of the Conference are extensive Hundreds of volunteers will be needed both before and during the Conference to assist in carrying out a full range of tasks to assure that this meeting fulfills the needs of delegates in their roles responding to the AIDS epidemic Volunteers will be needed to assist with office work act as hosts and monitors assist in Conference set up and tear down assist as runners for media representatives and for many other tasks We are certainly sensitive to the fact that many community based organizations are themselves in need of increased volunteer supp rat We are asking if it is in keeping with your needs if you would agree to circulate the attached volunteer registration form within your organization We hope that as with the Delegate Host Program the efforts of volunteers will exemplify the unique com miu nen t of Bay Area residents to the fight against AIDS If you have any questions about the delegate host program we hope you will contact Dana Van G order on our staff Dave Brack eris available to answer questions re garc fin g volunteers Dave will also be planning to contact you within the coming weeks Thank you very much

Host Program is to enable HIV infected people and representatives of community based AIDS organizations to attend the Sixth International Conference on AIDS who would otherwise be unable to afford to stay in San Francisco In many cases these Conference delegates will be people to whom the Conference has pr ovid free registration The Delegate Host Program asks San Francisco residents to provide free housing to delegates of the Sixth International Conference on AIDS from approximately the period of June 19 to 24 The Conference wi U recruit a list of San Fianc is can s willing to offer space to Conference delegates Then we will receive applications from delegates for donated housing Our computer will do its best to match hosts to guests Once the computer has done its part we will mail the name of one host to one guest The guest will be responsible for calling the host to assure that this match up is satisfactory Unless the Conference office hears from the guest that this matchup is NOT satisfactory we will assume that we have taken care of this particular delegate and move on to the next From that point on all details about the delegate's stay should be arranged between the delegate and his or her guest We hope that people will work together to negotiate details regarding the length of their stay pick up at the airport if possible and other arrangements Please contact Steve Tiger

PW A Health Group in New York City announced today that the group will join in boycotting the 6 th International Conference on AIDS in San Francisco in protest of U S travel restrictions for foreigners with HIV infection In supporting the boycott Ho del said While we regret not participating in the conference we felt it was crucial to take a firm political stand protesting the restrictive U S immigration laws It is inexcusable to have such restrictions for which there is no sound public health rationale on the hooks We hope the boycott sends a strong signal to the Bush administration that this policy is unacceptable Ho del had planned to present a paper during one of the conference's Social Science and Policy oral sessions titled ' Buyers ' Clubs ' and the Legit i miz ation of the

CRESCENT SOCIETIES ' POSITION ON ATTENDANCE AT THE VIth INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AIDS San Francisco June 20 24 1990 The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies decided in N oven ber 1989 to withdraw from participating in the Vl th International Conference on AIDS The reasons for this withdrawal were clearly outlined at the time and centred around our concern that the U S visa policy for people who are HIV positive might cause discrimination to HIV positive members of Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies who wished to attend the Conference A second statement was issued from the League Secretariat In January 1990 following some revisions In the application of the visa waiver procedure for people who are HIV positive and who wished to attend the Vl th International AIDS Conference Despite the welcome changes it was considered that they did not significantly alter the potential for discrimination of members of National Societies and our position on attending the Conference remained unaltered There have been further recent changes to the visa waiver procedure and once again we would like to express our solidarity and support for all those people within the United States of America who have helped to bring about these changes Including the American Red Cross Although the exact details of the changes and in particular the practical procedures for their implementation remain somewhat unclear from the available Information the concerns of the League about possible discrimination of HIV positive members of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies remain We have therefore decided to remain with our original position and not participate in the Conference This decision was supported during the recent meeting of the European and North American Red Cross and Red Crescent Task Force on AIDS and is shared by many International nongovernmental organisations and a number of governments We continue to urge US policy makers to make the necessary changes to their laws concerning people who are HIV positive in order to ensure that these laws and related regulations and procedures are based on sound public health principles and a caring and humanitarian approach to all people Since the Conference is now less than a month away and in vt ew of the need to take a final decision about our participation Irrespective of further changes in U S visa policy procedures the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies will not participate In the Vl th International Conference on AIDS 22 May 1990 D BDS F AID LC T 52 MICHAEL pg N br 24 May 23 90 9 12 0000 LI CROSS GENE U fl SUIT Z TEL 41 22 330395 PPl GE 05 r 7 t ' c Unfortunately there is a negative side to our withdrawal from this Conference It is very unfortunate that the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and many other NGC s will be absent from this Conference at a time when it is clearly so important that we develop partnerships and that all sectors and organisations cooperate and work together It is clear to everyone that N QO s have played a very important role in the fight against AIDS their absence will I believe make this only a partial Conference and will have a serious negative affect on the outcome The positive aspect of our withdrawal is that we have helped to bring about changes in the travel restrictions in the USA by providing support for those people within the USA who have fought for these changes However despite some progress as of mid May there is still a great deal of confusion and lack of clarity about what these changes actually are and how they would be implemented in practice We remain unconvinced that they significantly allay our concerns about potential discrimination of our members We have also shown that as a community NGOs at least are still able to take moral stands on Issues of international and individual importance And we have demonstrated that even though there are as many differences between NGOs as similarities on important matters we can stand together speak with one voice and act as a conscience for the International community I wish you every success with your Conference and hope that it makes an important contribution to the fight against AIDS However I also hope that we all le am from this experience and that such a situation will not be allowed to happen again Exchange of ideas experiences and information is certainly essential if we are to combat the AIDS pandemic But this will only be useful if advances can be put into practice and in order to do this we need to be able to ensure a caring and compassionate environment that is as free of discrimination as we would like it to be free of the virus and all the suffering that this virus causes PB D VI DE 0 LC T 52 MICHAEL 23 05 90 pg N br 25 P fir Sten b ck Video mess ag e to the VIth INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AIDS San Francisco June 20 24 1990 For the past 125 years the symbol of the Red Cross has stood for compassion and humanity It was born out of one man's horror and concern about the wounded and dying who lay un cared for and unattended on the battle field of Solferino Since this time the Red Cross has devoted Itself to preventing and alleviating the suffering of vulnerable individuals and communities around the world Irrespective of their race religion political or Ideological beliefs Over the years the battle fields have changed Today we have many new challenges such as economic recession environmental pollution and AIDS The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies with National Societies in 149 countries around the world has been very active in the fight against AIDS More than 100 Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies currently have AIDS related activities helping to prevent the spread of the virus and to provide care and support for people who are HIV positive people with AIDS their loved ones families and friends We have also taken a very strong stand against the pandemic of discrimination that has followed the HIV AIDS pandemic both because we believe that discrimination is fundamentally wrong and also because from a public health poln t of v lew preventing discrimination is essential to preventing the spread of the virus The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has participated in previous International Conferences on AIDS and as our involvement with the global effort has increased so has our involvement wil ii these Conferences Last year at the Conference in Montreal we had more than forty representatives from thirty countries This year however apart from this video message we will not be participating We are not participating in the VIth International AIDS Conference because we are concerned that the current travel restrictions fdr people who wish to enter the United States of America may cause discrimination to members of the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies who are HIV positive and who attend the Conference This Is obviously of great concern to us since we have consistently taken a strong stand against discrimination and since we have encouraged National Societies to Involve people who are HIV positive and people with AIDS in their programmes because of the Important perspective and experiences that they bring Of course there are broader Issues at stake and we add our voice to the concern expressed by the public health authorities within the United States and by the World Health Organisation about any travel restrictions which single out people who are HIV positive since these will do nothing to prevent the spread of the disease but are likely to be punitive and discriminatory Such measures merely reinforce the attitudes that fork against the control of this dreadful disease and Instead of preventing the spread they act as an obstacle to prevention pg N br 26 i Conference Boycott Gathers Steam A number of other Other AIDS service by Kevin Farrell organizations from Europe

opportunity for AIDS groups not affiliated with ACT NOW to either plan specific actions or to have input into the planning of actions for these days We are especially concerned that groups serving

what they'll do But that's part of the excitement for us and we see this as a very free and open expression of solidarity with people living with HIV infection If you know of any artists planning to

I yi n to Kevin Farrell from John James 861 2432 date 6 19 I i Enclosed Abstract form for Florence conference next year Here are my points about problems with the Conference Many other problems are not in this list for example expense and low cost access This writeup is NOT for attribution unless I have an editorial role in the statement as a whole probably not feasible Problems with Sixth International Conference All abstracts had to be submitted five months in advance And wording on the abstract forms discouraged researchers from presenting their work elsewhere in the interval As a result the Conference cast a five month shadow ahead of it a time of year when researchers are most reluctant to reveal to the public what they know This five month gap would hopefully discourage researchers with critically important results from submitting them to the Conference at all as it would be objectionable to conceal important health information for months Therefore the Conference policy on early submission and exclusivity almost guarantees that the most important advances will not be released at the Conference at all except perhaps by researchers who submitted an abstract on something else and obtained a speaker or poster slot The inflexibility of the Sixth International has forced researchers with late breaking results to take them to the alternative conference Advanced Immune Discoveries Symposium at Le Meri dien Hotel a block away instead one example is the hyperthermia treatment recently tried in Atlanta The International Conference also should be able to accommodate the most important fast developing stories Conference participants cannot see the abstracts until they register Then it is too late to read or s can the thousands of abstracts before meetings start This lack of advance information makes pg N br 32 2 participants spend valuable Conference time figuring out what is going on instead of planning which posters to visit in advance Over 1 500 abstracts were rejected this year compared to almost none rejected by last year ' International Conference in Montreal Yet no one today can be sure what will prove important in AIDS research And abstracts are harder to judge than larger papers because less information is available As a result decisions are unduly influenced by whether reviewers know the authors or know their reputations Observations which do not fit with conventional theories are unlikely to survive this system despite the clear inadequacy of the existing understanding of AIDS The abstract form for next year's conference in Florence Italy again requires a five month delay and exclusivity Therefore under current plans most if not all of the problems cited above are likely to be repeated next year pg N br 33 STATEMENT OF JEAN MCGUIRE Executive Director AIDS Action Council AIDS June 22 1990 Action Council Today the AIDS Action Council is launching a boycott of the San Francisco Marriott Hotel food services to protest the Corporation's support of the Chapman amendment to the Americans with Disabilities ADA Act It is unconscionable that the corporation that is hosting the international conference on AIDS has helped to perpetuate the fear and stigma associated with HIV through their endorsement of this amendment The Americans with Disabilities Act is currently pending in a conference between the House and Senate It will provide federal anti discrimination protections to all people with disabilities including those v it h AIDS and H TV infection This is the kind of discrimination protection the public health community has been calling for since the earliest stages of this epidemic In bringing the bill to conference both Houses endorsed the Chapman amendment which would limit protections available to food handlers who have contagious diseases The amendment was directly lobbied by Dick Marriott treasurer of the National Restaurant Association and continues to be supported by the Marriott Corporation Key votes on Chapman are expected early next week The Chapman Amendment is unnecessary because the ADA already allows employers to enforce public health communicable disease standards in employment decisions In promoting this amendment HIV was the target of the Congressional discussion and continues to be the focus of Marriott's concerns even though this is a communicable disease that is not trans miss able through food handling Marriott's position on this amendment contradicts its own internal employment policies which quite liberally guarantee the rights of workers with HIV This makes their public stance and lobbying efforts that much more reprehensible Our challenge to Marriott today is to join us in making their own workplace guarantees the law of the land As the ADA conference report goes to a final vote next week Marriott has the opportunity to lead corporate America in good HIV public policy or to be a part of continuing to perpetuate irrational fears

CHA AN AMENDMENT OPPOSE HIV DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FOOD HANDLERS BOYCOTT MARRIOTT FOOD SERVICES Congress is considering allowing disc ri in mati on against people with H TV infection who handle food on their jobs the Chapman amendment to the Americans with Disabilities Act This amendment is based on unfounded fears and runs counter to all public health guidelines The Marriott Corporation one of the largest hotel corporations in the United States has supported this limitation Marriott is the headquarters site for the Sixth International Conference on AIDS which seeks to translate sound scientific findings into reasonable public policy By refusing to take a strong stand against the food handler amendment the Chapman Amendment Marriott continues to support irrational perceptions about H TV transmission that were resolved long ago HIV is not transmitted via food handling The Marriott has chosen to ignore this fact Until the Marriott Corporation joins in opposing these infringements on the rights of people with HIV we urge conference participants to boycott all food services restaurants and room service at the Marriott To support the boycott Do not order room service or eat in

ACT NOW The ADS Coalition to Network Organize and Win pg N br 41 SAN FRANCISCO STATEMENT We as People with Immune System Disorders P IS D express our outrage that government bureaucrats pharmaceutical executives and researchers including those participating in the Sixth International Conference on AIDS have locked us out of decisions affecting our lives We demand access to all information affecting our lives We demand a voice in every step of the process from the inception of an idea for research through the actual research up until the idea becomes a reality Furthermore we demand 1 Access to quality health care to all people worldwide regardless of ability to pay Health care is a right 2 Access to effective research programs for AIDS HIV and other Immune System Disorders These programs must be designed to save the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people worldwide who are expected to die from AIDS in the next three years 3 Unbiased information on and access to alternative treatments including vitamin and herbal therapies acupuncture homeopathy and other non pharmaceutical treatments To this end alternative treatments must be included in official conferences and AIDS service referrals These treatments must be covered by private and government health insurance plans We have a right to make informed choices among all possible treatments 4 The expansion and or initiation of studies of disease progression and detection in groups who may have a different response to HIV because of biochemical or cultural differences including women tr an sexual s injection drug users children adolescents and people of color 5 An end to placebo controlled trials for treatments of life threatening conditions For many people clinical trials are the only form of healthcare available Placebo trials are immoral because they prevent treatment and access to healthcare 6 Worldwide access for all People with Immune System Disorders to data A n international databank to make available all medical information related to immune system disorders must be created This includes all data concerning drugs and treatments especially basic bio chemical research and the initiation of clinical trials Additionally there must be public access to all medical and research information regarding AIDS and the cross referencing of data and treatment information between AIDS and other Immune System Disorders such as Cytomegalovirus Epstein Barr Virus and Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome etc Also we demand the creation of an international database on the full prevalence of all AIDS complications pg N br 42 7 Civil rights for all People with Immune System Disorders We need anti discrimination legislation protecting jobs housing and access to services full legal recognition of lesbian gay and bisexual relationships respect fortran sexual rights anonymous and absolutely confidential HIV antibody testing as well as pre and post test counseling housing that meets the medical needs of People with Immune System Disorders substance abuse treatment the same standard of care and treatment for prisoners as for the general population the right of people faced with a life threatening illness to choose treatments they deem beneficial for themselves to stop mandatory testing and quarantine under any circumstances to end all restrictions on the international movement or immigration of people with HIV to end the forced sterilization of women enrolling in research protocols and to stop research with prisoners under duress or without informed consent 8 The legislation and regulations of all governments must reflect the fact that HIV is not commonly contagious Casual contact presents no threat of infection and irrational fears of transmission must be fought 9 Access to international education programs outlining comprehensive sex information affirming and supportive of all sexual orientations in culturally sensitive ways and describing safer sex needle hygiene and other means of preventing Sexually Transmitted Diseases HIV and other viruses 10 Access to health care All governments and all international health organizations must treat AIDS and other Immune System Disorders positively and aggressively Ensuring access and availability of treatment must be part of the social and moral obligations of governments to their citizens AIDS research and healthcare funding must not compete with other pressing healthcare priorities The entire biomedical research budget must be drastically increased to meet the world's healthcare crisis In the U S all branches of the government must provide leadership and a comprehensive coordinated AIDS research education and prevention effort with enhanced funding to keep pace with the epidemic Primary health care provisions must be comprehensive providing culturally sensitive care and information for the individual and her his family Recognition that in most parts of the world poverty is a critical co factor in immune suppression Thus industrialized nations must establish an internationally developed fund to assist poor and developing countries to meet their healthcare responsibilities including the provision of condoms facilities for a clean blood supply and adequate supplies of sterile needles as well as a full range of medical services and treatments and educational materials In addition conversion of military spending worldwide to medical health and basic social services is essential pg N br 43 11 Access to an international health organization seriously dedicated to combatting immune System Disorders We condemn the World Health Organization WHO for failing to coordinate an international response to the AIDS epidemic and for not addressing Immune System Disorders We demand an internationally coordinated effort to halt AIDS and other immune System Disorders to provide treatment for all people infected with immune System Disorders and to advocate for those who are discriminated against and oppressed due to their immune status 12 Participatory power in the decision making process regarding research and treatment Restructure the AIDS Clinical Trial Group ACT G of the U S National Institutes of Health decision making The ACT G Executive Committee must be restructured to include representatives of all ACT G committees and from the communities affected by AIDS We demand that the ACT G Reveal conflicts of interest All ACT G funded investigators must make public details of all financial and historical links they maintain with pharmaceutical sponsors They must abstain from the selection process where these sponsors ' drugs are involved ' Focus on developing NEW treatments The ACT G must research all promising new treatments including non drug treatments such as Passive Immuno Therapy in small technology intensive Phase i il safety activity studies to get new effective treatments out the door Then pharmaceutical sponsors and community based groups can conduct larger treatment trials Focus on the entire range of AIDS morbidity and mortality Over 90 percent of AIDS death are caused by opportunistic infections Ol s but just 17 percent of ACT G subjects so far have been in 01 trials The ACT G must immediately start trials designed to prevent or treat the most serious and widespread Ol s CM V MAI fungal infections to xo plasm os is crypto spor i dios is the HIV associated cancers KS and lymphomas and chlamydia and other vaginal Ol s that occur in women living with AIDS Diversify research priorities In the next two years the ACT G must make the five major opportunistic infections treatable or preventable must improve quality of treatments for AIDS associated cancers must intensify research into rebuilding the immune system including fetal tissue research and must initiate a good faith effort to analyze alternatives to pharmaceutical therapy including holistic non pharmaceutical and nutritional approaches Initiate flexible innovative multi agent combination trials The future of HIV treatment lies with combination therapy It's time to initiate nationwide combination trials with alternating or sequential anti HIV agents plus immune rebuilding treatments and multi opportunistic infection prophylaxis pg N br 44 End medical apartheid open trials to ALL HIV infected people ACT G trials must be open to the entire spectrum of the HIV infected population Exclusion criteria must be compensated for by open enrollment safety treatment trials for all AIDS complications Enrollment of underrepresented groups including women African Americans Latinos as Native Americans Asians Pacific Islanders and present and former drug users must be enhanced through the provision of health care transportation subsidies childcare and addiction treatment Streamline pediatric treatment access The ACT G must design treatment trials for children and adolescents as soon as treatments prove safe in adult Phase I studies Provide state of the art clinical care within AIDS clinical trials ACT G trials must provide participants with state of the art therapies as they evolve Rapidly translate results into clinical practice NI AID's Division of AIDS must establish an Office of HIV AIDS Clinical Care to provide state of the art treatment guidelines and to oversee the rapid translation of trial results into clinical practice Conduct research where the need is greatest When the ACT U grants are renewed research sites should be established in high incidence areas now un served AIDS research and healthcare need to be provided together in all high HIV incidence areas ' Funding for the various ACT G sites should be apportioned on the basis of the needs of the community served and the willingness of the Principal Investigators to comply with the above demands 13 Access to ail government functions affecting the AIDS crisis All NIH AIDS meetings including those of NI AID its Division of AIDS ACT G conferences and core committees the AIDS Clinical Drug Development Committee and the National Cooperative Drug Discovery Groups must be open internationally to People with Immune System Disorders including activists and the press 14 Alteration of the U S Centers for Disease Control's CDC definition of AIDS to reflect the full spectrum and diversity of AIDS and HIV related diseases The current definition of AIDS is obsolete It denies treatment care and social services to poor people who do not fit their definition of AIDS 11 does not include opportunistic infections that affect children adolescents women people of color and injection drug users As a result we are denied access to life saving treatments It also denies early intervention therapy to a symptomatic HIV infected people The current definition is designed to under count the full extent of the pandemic resulting in a lack of funding pg N br 45 I 15 Decriminalization of needle possession and immediate implementation of government funded programs to provide effective appropriate treatment on demand and distribution of free sterile needles for injection drug users 16 Access to all AIDS conferences for People with Immune System Disorders P IS D must be guaranteed All future AIDS conferences must beheld in countries that do not have travel restrictions based on HIV status race pastor present drug use or sexual orientation All P IS D must be given free entry into the conferences P IS D from non industrialized countries must be given travel scholarships to attend P IS D must be represented on all conference panels pg N br 46 NO MORE WORD S WE WANT ACTION Thus far during this conference ACT UP has made many points without disrupting the exchange of scientific information However today's scheduled speech by Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr Louis B Sullivan is not a scientific presentation After 10 years of Bush Reagan rhetoric on AIDS we will no longer tolerate words without action You will not hear Louis Sullivan today THE BUSH SULLIVAN CRIMES THE We have to WORDS fight the disease not the people with the disease THE ACTION HIV positive individuals are denied entry to and deported from the U S A We are on a war time THE WORDS footing against AIDS THE The Bush Administration ACTION opposes the AIDS CARE legislation intended to provide disaster relief funds for devastated communities THE WORDS Every time there is a promising treatment opportunity we pursue it THE ACTION ACT UP has identified over 99 drugs that have shown promise as possible AIDS treatments VIRTUALLY NONE OF THESE ARE SLATED FOR GOVERNMENT TRIALS THE WORDS Clean needle exchange programs are a viable option in control of the spread of HIV among IV drug users THE ACTION Just as Louis Sullivan has abandoned women by flip flopping on abortion so he has abandoned IV drug users by flip flopping on needle exchange and bleach distribution programs leaving them to die THE WORDS I want a kinder gentler nation THE ACTION The Bush Administration says this nation cannot afford to offer health care to over 37 million uninsured Americans The U S and South Africa remain the only industrialized nations without national health care WE INVITE YOU TO JOIN US IN PROTEST STAND AND TURN YOUR BACK ON SULLIVAN AND HIS MEANINGLESS RHETORIC pg N br 47 Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr Louis B Sullivan as the highest ranking government official and a person of color has failed to voice the concerns of communities of color regarding the spread of HIV infection People of color are disproportionately over represented in the demographics of this epidemic Entire generations are being wiped out Yet Dr Sullivan's prescription is an absurd health policy dictated by partisan politics We demand effective and humane leadership Science not politics Education not ignorance Health care not lip service pg N br 48 TO ALL THE GRANT GRABBER S EMPIRE BUILDERS E GOT RIPPERS IN THE SCI EN TinC AND MEDICAL COMMUNITIES WHOSE ONLY
